More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]', '. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. The most highly represented phyla in the gastric mucosa under normal conditions are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (recently renamed to Bacillota36), Bacteroidetes (recently renamed to Bacteroidota36), Actinobacteria, and Fusobacte- ria.37−39 The gastric juice has a diverse microbial community that differs from the gastric mucosa. The dominating phyla in gastric juice are Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gastric mucosa.37,40,41 Furthermore, bacteria found in the oral cavity and duodenum such as Veillonella, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium can transiently colonize the stomach.40,42 Unsurprisingly, H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H', '. 3.1.1. Increasing the Abundance of Specific Members of the Microbiome. A low microbial diversity of the human microbiome is significantly associated with several diseases.206 However, the changes observed in the microbiome composition might be dissimilar in different populations. For example, Dutch and Belgian cohorts showed a negative correlation between the Bacteroidetes enrichment and diversity,207 whereas a positive correlation was observed between Bacteroidetes and diversity in African individuals,208 underscoring the need for population- specific comparisons of the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients. The ratio of the two most dominant phyla in the microbiome, namely, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, is one of the most important parameters representing microbiome diversity, at least in the gut', '. Eubiosis conditions are eﬀective in controlling various diseases caused by microbes. Proper intake of a healthy diet and the development of eubiosis acts in favor of human health. The high intake of antibiotics causes an imbalance in the gut microbiota and favors systemic diseases (Santacroce et al., 2021). Several population-based studies have revealed the highly beneﬁcial role of human gut microbiota in healthy people, as well as the importance of well-understanding its structure and the factors that inﬂuence its composition, such as food, age, geography, systemic disorders, and drugs (Wang et al., 2017; Rowland et al., 2018). Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019)', '. Rev.

Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019). The ﬁrst step in identifying the symbiotic interactions between intestinal microbes and their hosts is to describe the balanced composition of gut microbiota and disease-related variations. The microbes reside in a mutual association with the host in a healthy state, aﬀecting the host’s health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells to promote host physiology and immunity (Ribaldone et al., 2022). An initial underestimation of the total number of microbial species in the intestine has been described through several vivo and ex vivo studies due to complications in culturing certain microorganisms (Lagier et al., 2015)', '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]. During the ﬁrst year of life, the microbial diversity increases and the microbiota composition converges towards a distinct adult-like microbial proﬁle with temporal patterns that are unique to each infant [32]. By around 2.5 years of age, the composition, diversity and functional capabilities of the infant microbiota resemble those of adult microbiota [24,25]. Although, in adulthood, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable, it is still subject to perturbation by life events [33]. In individuals over the age of 65, the microbial community shifts, with an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes phyla and Clostridium cluster IV, in contrast with younger subjects where cluster XIVa is more prevalent [34]', '. Hence, the colonic microbiome is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria, including thousands of species and millions of genes, distrib- uted among the major phyla of Firmicutes (predom- inantly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia)7–10 (figure 1). Excreted as faeces, it is this biomass that makes up what is usually termed the gut microbiome that has been associated with a plethora of diseases and is highly modifiable by diet and drugs (table 1)', '. Addition- ally, gut microbiota varies in different anatomical parts of the GI tract. For example, Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are found in the small intestine but not the colon. Instead, Bacteriodetes such as Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenella- ceae are often found in the colon.19 Such variations are majorly due to the different environments. In the small intestine, the transit time is short and bile concentration is high, while in the colon, which has slower ﬂow rates and milder pH, as well as larger microbial communities, especially anaerobic types, are commonly observed.20 Besides spatial distribution, gut microbiota also differs by age', '. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H. pylori strains can modulate the gastric environment, thus altering the habitat of resident microorganisms.44 Furthermore, alterations in the gastric microbiome community can increase the risk for developing gastric cancer.39 It was also reported that eradicating H. pylori increased microbial diversity in the stomach.45 Even though interactions between H. pylori and commensal bacteria in the stomach are not fully understood, the discovery of its direct effect on the healthy gastric microbiome may shed some light on ways to modulate the gastric microbiome to prevent progression to severe disease. 2.2.1.3. Intestines. The gut is the most densely and diversely colonized organ, with a bacterial-to-host cell ratio of 1:1. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine', '. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health. Under the Proteobacteria phylum, some well-known pathogens include Enterobacter, Helicobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age', '. nucleatum has a role in CRC progression and metastasis. Non-bacterial dysbiosis. Thus far, most studies of microbial dysbiosis in the context of CRC have focused on bacteria owing to their rela\xad tively high abundance in the GI tract (comprising 93% of gut microbial sequences)44. However, improvements in sequencing technologies have enabled the detection of non-bacterial components of the gut Introduction The human gut microbiota is an ecosystem populated by bacteria, fungi, viruses, Archaea and parasites whose cells in total typically outnumber those of the host1. The number of microbial species resid\xad ing in the human gut is usually in the order of thousands at any given time2, representing a much greater level of genetic diversity than that of the human genome. Colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal (GI) tract begins in early life and co-evolves concomitantly with the host throughout development and adult life', '. It has been found that gut microbiota in humans and animal models of obesity is reduced in abundance of Bacteroidetes with a proportional increase in Firmicutes phylum, however, these results have been contradicted by other studies reporting divergent ratios between these two phyla (Duncan et al., 2008; Abdallah Ismail et al., 2011; Harris et al., 2012). Our study focused not only on diﬀerences in the composition of gut microbiota of obese patients compared to CTRLs, but also on changes between young and adult study participants in order to verify an age-related association between microbes and obesity. The microbiota proﬁle in obese adolescents resulted diﬀerentially composed respect to obese adults, leading to suppose a synergic role of age and obesity in microbiota composition. However, the main diﬀerences in microbiota composition were evidenced comparing adolescent obese and NW. In fact, the OTU-based model assigned the microbial markers F', '. The Western diet is overall linked to the surge of chronic inflammation72,73,81 leading to diet- related diseases, including obesity and many other non-communicable diseases14. Global diets associated with the microbiome Global regions have unique dietary patterns that impact the gut microbiome and host health. However, distinguishing its impacts from host-specific attributes to global or local environmental influ- ences poses a challenge, as other factors such as ethnicity also notably influence gut microbiota composition74,82. A recent study has char- acterized 5,230 gut metagenomes, reporting that members of the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera and the Firmicutes phylum are the dominant enterosignatures of Western populations, whereas non-Western populations have predominantly Prevotella spp', 'Page 10 of 12 Zhang et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2025) 25:453 the transformation of important chemical substances, including drugs [7]. In theory, the prolonged and mul- tifaceted use of broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotics, as seen in anti-tuberculosis therapy, may exert significant impacts on the gut microbiota, both immediately and in the long term. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the predominant phyla within the gut microbiota [40]. Bacteria within the phylum Bacteroidota are capable of utilizing dietary fibers, resulting in the production of SCFAs [41]. Also known as volatile fatty acids, SCFAs include acetate, pro- pionate, and butyrate [21]', '. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), based on Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac and weighted UniFrac distances were performed to identify the difference in fecal microbiota composition between PTB patients and HCs. As shown in Figure 1D, there was a tendency of separation and had a partial overlap between two groups, which demonstrated that the total community of gut microbiota in the two groups was different. The compositions of the fecal microbiota in the PTB patients and the HCs were assessed at different taxonomic levels, and the top 20 relative abundance of bacteria were shown in Figure 2A. At the phylum level, we observed an enrichment of Bacteroidota (33.10% vs. 27.08%), Proteobacteria(12.99% vs. 9.83%) and Fusobacteriota(0.58% vs. 0.56%, P<0.05), and a remarkable decrease of Firmicutes(48.07% vs. 55.89%, P<0.05) and Actinobacteriota(2.44% vs. 5.83%, P<0.01) in PTB patients compared with HCs (Figure 2B)', 'Page 9 of 12 Zhang et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2025) 25:453 [39]. Normally, the gut microbiota maintains a stable structure with probiotics and harmful bacteria each retaining a certain proportion. However, external envi- ronmental disturbances and other diseases of the host can significantly impact the composition, diversity, and abundance of the gut microbiota. Concurrently, the gut microbiota plays a considerably important role in human health. Recent research on gut microbiota has revealed that its influence on the human body extends far beyond a simple symbiotic relationship. The diverse gut microbiota not only engages in material and infor- mation exchange among themselves but also continu- ously communicates with host cells, co-evolves with the host, participates in host metabolism, and regulates Fig. 4 Differential species analysis at the genus level', '. The liquid phase of the gut lumen comprises a diversity of microorganisms and specialized primary colonizers like Ruminococcus spp. depending upon the dietary fibers found in the gut lumen.60 Given that the small intestine has a fairly short transit time of ∼3−5 h in digestion, the presence of high bile concentrations that possess antimicrobial activity61 makes the small intestine a challenging environment for microbial colonizers.61 Molecular analysis has revealed that the jejunal and ileal components comprise mainly facultative anaerobes, including the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroides and the Streptococci, Lactobacilli, and Enterococci species.62,63 Gut bacteria are crucial for regulating digestion along the gastrointestinal tract', '. Yet, the in vitro spectrum of activity of an antibiotic does not always predict in vivo species trajectories in a multi-species microbiome during anti- biotic exposure93–96. For example, despite the in vitro Gram-positive- specific action of vancomycin, its oral administration (in human and animals) results in distinct loss of several Gram-negative gut micro\xad biome commensals including Bacteroides, Prevotella and Alistipes spp.97. These observations underline the complexity of microbial metabolic networks in the microbiome, built by a diversity of mutu- alistic and competitive relationships across phyla. These community networks almost certainly alter antibiotic killing in the microbiome98. In vitro studies of interactions between two gut commensals during antibiotic treatment indicate that symbiotic relationships can have multiple outcomes in effecting differences in antibiotic tolerance in one99 or both members of the community100,101', '. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]. The gut microbiota is not as diverse as the microbial communities from some other bodily sites and reveals a high degree of functional redundancy [19–21]. An extensive catalogue of the functional capacity of the human gut microbiome was recently obtained, where 9 879 896 genes were identiﬁed through a combination of 249 newly sequenced and 1018 published samples [18]. The study identiﬁed the presence of country-speciﬁc microbial signatures, suggesting that gut microbiota composition is shaped by environmental factors, such as diet, and possibly also by host genetics [18]. However, it should also be noted that microbiotas that differ in terms of composition may share some degree of functional redundancy, yielding similar protein or metabolite proﬁles [22]', '.

In this section, we present different methods by which the human microbiome can be rationally engineered. We also discuss examples that demonstrate that microbiome engineering is a viable way to target diseases and enhance human health. 3.1. Changing the Population Dynamics of the Microbiome The composition of the human microbiome is unique to every individual and is constantly fluctuating due to factors such as age, diet, host genetics, and medication. Nevertheless, distinct microbiome profiles have been associated with specific diseases by comparing the differences between patients and healthy controls. These differences can occur at any level of the taxonomic rank, with previous reports showing phylum-level to species-level associations.205 Several methods have been applied to correct microbiome differences with varying specificity and magnitude, as discussed later. 3.1.1.

Yet, the in vitro spectrum of activity of an antibiotic does not always predict in vivo species trajectories in a multi-species microbiome during anti- biotic exposure93–96. For example, despite the in vitro Gram-positive- specific action of vancomycin, its oral administration (in human and animals) results in distinct loss of several Gram-negative gut micro\xad biome commensals including Bacteroides, Prevotella and Alistipes spp.97. These observations underline the complexity of microbial metabolic networks in the microbiome, built by a diversity of mutu- alistic and competitive relationships across phyla.

Nevertheless, distinct microbiome profiles have been associated with specific diseases by comparing the differences between patients and healthy controls.

Introduction The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents one of the largest interfaces (250–400 m2) between the host, environmental factors and antigens in the human body. In an average life time, around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract, along with an abundance of microorganisms from the environment which impose a huge threat on gut integrity [1]. The collection of bacteria, archaea and eukarya colonising the GI tract is termed the ‘gut microbiota’ and has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years to form an intricate and mutually beneﬁcial relationship [2,3]. The number of microorganisms inhabiting the GI tract has been estimated to exceed 1014, which encom- passes ∼10 times more bacterial cells than the number of human cells and over 100 times the amount of genomic content (microbiome) as the human genome [2,4].

Many studies worldwide have focused on the signiﬁcant impact of intestinal microbiota on human health and disease (AboNahas et al., 2022). The human body is colonized by a diversity of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. Microbes inhabit all human body surfaces, but a signiﬁcant number of microbes live in the gastrointestinal tract/gut. The human gut possesses approximately more than one thousand microbial species that form a complex ecological community called gut microbiota (Lagier et al., 2016). The human gut microbiota is carrying about 150 times more genes compared to the entire human genome', 'Page 9 of 14 Huh et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:203 Fig. 3 (See legend on previous page.)', '. The underlying mechanisms for reduced diversity are proposed to include antibiotic utilization, clinical practices (e.g., cesarean sections), and sanitation (Son- nenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014). In agreement with this notion, 706 Cell Host & Microbe 23, June 13, 2018 Cell Host & Microbe Review', '. However, a recently revised estimate has suggested that the ratio of human:bacterial cells is actually closer to 1:1 [5]. As a result of the vast number of bacterial cells in the body, the host and the microorganisms inhabiting it are often referred to as a ‘superorganism’ [4,6]. The microbiota offers many beneﬁts to the host, through a range of physiological functions such as strengthening gut integrity or shaping the intestinal epithelium [7], harvesting energy [8], protecting against pathogens [9] and regulating host immunity [10]. However, there is potential for these mechanisms to be disrupted as a result of an altered microbial composition, known as dysbiosis. With increasingly sophisticated methods to proﬁle and characterise complex ecosystems being developed, a role for the microbiota in a large number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases has become steadily apparent [11,12]', '.

These results, performed in a cohort of 55 volunteers from the Haitian community, thus reinforces the hypothesis that the relative abundance of speciﬁc gastrointestinal microbiota members, which we ﬁnd to be perturbed by TB therapy, correlates with inﬂammatory peripheral gene expression in humans. Discussion Since the advent of high-throughput microbiome characteriza- tion, it has become clear that antibiotics are one of the most common and severe perturbing inﬂuences on human microbiome composition, with both acute and longer lasting effects56,57. It also has become evident that the speciﬁc microbiome constituents have speciﬁc effects on host immunity, including inﬂuencing the abundance and function of immune cell subsets24', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. In general, the major bacteria present in oral microbiota are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacter- oidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Although healthy human lungs were long considered sterile, numerous studies have demonstrated that microbiota is also present in lung tissues.11 The core lung microbiota included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The composition of lung microbiota is primarily determined by three factors: 1) microbial immigration, 2) the elimination of micro- organisms, and 3) the reproduction rates of microorganisms.12 In human skin, the distribution and variety of glands and hair follicles vary among each geographic region. The physical and chemical differences of skin regions create distinct composition of microbiota.13 Generally, the skin microbiota is composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria', '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', '. In fact, the dose of dietary ﬁber used in animal studies more closely resembles the estimated amount of ﬁber consumed by our ancestors before the advent of agriculture (>100 g/day) (Eaton et al., 1997). Therefore, even ﬁber doses that meet the dietary recommendations of today (\x0130 g/day) (Jones, 2014) are still far below the ﬁber amounts ingested when the symbiosis between us and the microbes was formed (Deehan and Walter, 2016).

In addition to enrichment of overtly pathogenic organisms following antibiotic exposure, antibiotics are increasingly considered key contributors to more complex immunological manifestations such as graft-versus-host disease, inflammatory bowel disease and even allergies in the host5,19–21. Understanding how different antibiotics disturb the human gut micro- biome is thus critical for mitigating diseases related to microbiome dysbiosis. Another unintended consequence of the steady increase in antibiotic utilization worldwide22 has been the concomitant rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), compromising the treatment of resistant bacterial infections23,24. In 2019, an estimated 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR worldwide25', '. The human gut microbiota is carrying about 150 times more genes compared to the entire human genome. It is widely accepted that approximately a hundred trillion microbes live on and inside the human body having a key role in various biological processes including health and disease (Wang et al., 2017). They are the primary mediators of body homeostasis, impacting various physiological activities, such as metabolism, barrier homeostasis, inﬂammation, and hematopoiesis through both intestinal and extra-intestinal actions. The gut microbiota has recently been classiﬁed as a “vital organ” because of its multidirectional and communicational connection or axis with other organs through neural, endocrine, humoral, immunological, and metabolic pathways', '. For instance, our body temperature is optimal for housing many different types of microbes. Other factors, such as the presence of nutrient sources like sebum, change the skin’s pH and also act as a carbon source, facilitating the growth of certain groups of microbes.5 Interestingly, the dense layer of mucus that covers the intestinal epithelium not only serves as a carbon source for microbes but also provides attachment sites for bacterial adhesion.6 The abundance and diversity of the human microbiota is dependent on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the nature of body environments, as previously described, as the physiology of habitat sites facilitates the growth of some microbes. Other intrinsic factors that contribute to the microbiome’s composition include genetics, ethnicity, gender, and age. The human microbiome is generally stable and resistant once the microorganism has adapted to the environ- ment', '. 32, 834–841 doi:10.1038/nbt.2942 19 Schluter, J., Foster, K.R., Ellner, S.P.

Based on the Unweighted unifrac distance, the principal coordi\xad nate analysis (PCoA) exhibited distinctly different clus\xad tering results of samples between the TB group and the HC group (Fig. 1b). It clearly indicates that microbial community composition has been altered in TB patients. We analyzed the gut microbial composition at different taxonomic levels to assess which bacteria are predomi\xad nantly altered in TB patients. At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was notably increased while Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were significantly decreased in TB patients compared with the healthy sub\xad jects (Fig. 1c, Table S2). At the genus level, the variation trend of dominant bacterial genera (an abundance > 0.1% in the two groups) is shown in Table S3', '. For example, we identiﬁed an increase in pathways producing cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and the enterobacterial common antigen (DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY; UDPNAGSYN-PWY; PWY-6386; PWY-7315; PWY0-1241; PWY-1269; PWY0-1586) (Supplementary Figure 5). For these pathways, we computed each bacterial genus and family’s contribution. This information allowed us to learn about bacterial taxa that are likely assembling cell walls at an increased pace (Supplementary Figure 5). Our analysis identiﬁed major contributors (taxa contributing more than 1% of the total) from the following families: Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Prevotellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, Hafniaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Vibrionaceae, belonging mainly to the phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes', '. 2. HUMAN MICROBIOME Microbiome research has advanced rapidly over the past few decades and has now become a topic of great scientific and public interest. Historically, the field of microbiome research emerged from environmental microbiome research and later evolved into viewing eukaryotes as inseparable from the microbial community with which they share space. After all, the human body is an ecosystem where trillions of tiny organisms coexist with the host. The scientific term “micro- biome” therefore refers to the set of genes of all microorganisms that inhabit almost all human body parts. The microbiome is thus considered as a second genome that has a symbiotic relationship with the host. This relationship may be positive or beneficial, negative or pathogenic, or neutral; hence, micro- biome interactions play a key role in human health']","[{'content': '. Introduction The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents one of the largest interfaces (250–400 m2) between the host, environmental factors and antigens in the human body. In an average life time, around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract, along with an abundance of microorganisms from the environment which impose a huge threat on gut integrity [1]. The collection of bacteria, archaea and eukarya colonising the GI tract is termed the ‘gut microbiota’ and has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years to form an intricate and mutually beneﬁcial relationship [2,3]. The number of microorganisms inhabiting the GI tract has been estimated to exceed 1014, which encom- passes ∼10 times more bacterial cells than the number of human cells and over 100 times the amount of genomic content (microbiome) as the human genome [2,4].

Many studies worldwide have focused on the signiﬁcant impact of intestinal microbiota on human health and disease (AboNahas et al., 2022). The human body is colonized by a diversity of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. Microbes inhabit all human body surfaces, but a signiﬁcant number of microbes live in the gastrointestinal tract/gut. The human gut possesses approximately more than one thousand microbial species that form a complex ecological community called gut microbiota (Lagier et al., 2016).

However, a recently revised estimate has suggested that the ratio of human:bacterial cells is actually closer to 1:1 [5]. As a result of the vast number of bacterial cells in the body, the host and the microorganisms inhabiting it are often referred to as a ‘superorganism’ [4,6]. The microbiota offers many beneﬁts to the host, through a range of physiological functions such as strengthening gut integrity or shaping the intestinal epithelium [7], harvesting energy [8], protecting against pathogens [9] and regulating host immunity [10]. However, there is potential for these mechanisms to be disrupted as a result of an altered microbial composition, known as dysbiosis. With increasingly sophisticated methods to proﬁle and characterise complex ecosystems being developed, a role for the microbiota in a large number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases has become steadily apparent [11,12]', 'filename': '1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.0587, 'page_numbers': '[1]', 'title': 'Review Article'}, {'content': '.

These results, performed in a cohort of 55 volunteers from the Haitian community, thus reinforces the hypothesis that the relative abundance of speciﬁc gastrointestinal microbiota members, which we ﬁnd to be perturbed by TB therapy, correlates with inﬂammatory peripheral gene expression in humans. Discussion Since the advent of high-throughput microbiome characteriza- tion, it has become clear that antibiotics are one of the most common and severe perturbing inﬂuences on human microbiome composition, with both acute and longer lasting effects56,57.

Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', 'filename': '5-Microbiota in health and diseases.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.0448, 'page_numbers': '[3]', 'title': 'REVIEW ARTICLE'}, {'content': '. In general, the major bacteria present in oral microbiota are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacter- oidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Although healthy human lungs were long considered sterile, numerous studies have demonstrated that microbiota is also present in lung tissues.11 The core lung microbiota included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The composition of lung microbiota is primarily determined by three factors: 1) microbial immigration, 2) the elimination of micro- organisms, and 3) the reproduction rates of microorganisms.12 In human skin, the distribution and variety of glands and hair follicles vary among each geographic region. The physical and chemical differences of skin regions create distinct composition of microbiota.13 Generally, the skin microbiota is composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria', 'filename': '5-Microbiota in health and diseases.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.0303, 'page_numbers': '[1]', 'title': 'REVIEW ARTICLE'}, {'content': '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', 'filename': '2-Gut microbiome and health- mechanistic insights.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.0274, 'page_numbers': '[1]', 'title': 'Recent advances in basic science'}, {'content': '. In fact, the dose of dietary ﬁber used in animal studies more closely resembles the estimated amount of ﬁber consumed by our ancestors before the advent of agriculture (>100 g/day) (Eaton et al., 1997).

HUMAN MICROBIOME Microbiome research has advanced rapidly over the past few decades and has now become a topic of great scientific and public interest. Historically, the field of microbiome research emerged from environmental microbiome research and later evolved into viewing eukaryotes as inseparable from the microbial community with which they share space. After all, the human body is an ecosystem where trillions of tiny organisms coexist with the host. The scientific term “micro- biome” therefore refers to the set of genes of all microorganisms that inhabit almost all human body parts. The microbiome is thus considered as a second genome that has a symbiotic relationship with the host. This relationship may be positive or beneficial, negative or pathogenic, or neutral; hence, micro- biome interactions play a key role in human health', 'filename': '6-Microbiome and Human Health.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': -0.0446, 'page_numbers': '[2]', 'title': 'Microbiome and Human Health: Current Understanding,'}]",0.0468,"['According', 'Fuchs', 'Milo', 'Sender', 'While']"

**Vaginal Delivery**
*   **Inoculation Source:** Infants are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth.
*   **Microbial Composition:** These infants show a high abundance of *Lactobacilli* during the first few days, reflecting the high load of *Lactobacilli* in the vaginal flora.
*   **Diversity and Specific Taxa:** At three days of age, naturally delivered infants possess a greater abundance and variety of *Bifidobacterium* spp. compared to those born via C-section.
*   **Similarity to Mother:** Approximately 72% of the fecal microbiota of vaginally delivered infants resembles their mother’s fecal microbiota.

**Caesarean Section (C-section) Delivery**
*   **Inoculation Source:** Infants are initially exposed to skin microbiota and the microbiome found in the surrounding environment.
*   **Microbial Composition:** The microbiota is often colonized by facultative anaerobes, such as *Clostridium* species.
*   **Deficiencies and Delays:** C-section delivery is associated with decreased gut microbiota diversity and a depleted or delayed colonization of the *Bacteroides* genus (and the *Bacteroidetes* phylum).
*   **Similarity to Mother:** Only 41% of the fecal microbiota in C-section babies resembles their mother’s fecal microbiota.

Regardless of the delivery mode, the gut microbiome typically changes to resemble that of an adult by the age of 3.","['. Mode of Delivery Affects the Bacterial Community in the Newborn Gut.

The human microbiome is generally stable and resistant once the microorganism has adapted to the environ- ment. On top of intrinsic factors that may cause a shift in the microbiome over time, extrinsic factors such as diet, lifestyle, medication, geographic location, climate, and seasonality may cause changes to the microbial community. Moreover, the mode of delivery during birth has been shown to influence the microbiome. For example, newborns delivered via the vaginal versus Caesarean delivery possess different groups of dominat- ing gut microbiome. However, at the age of 3, the gut microbiome changes to resemble that of the adult’s gut microbiome.7 As people reach beyond the age of 70, the ability to digest food and absorb nutrients in the gut changes, affecting the composition of the gut microbiome', '. After birth, the GI tract is rapidly colonised, with life events such as illness, antibiotic treatment and changes in diet causing chaotic shifts in the microbiota [24,25]. The mode of delivery also appears to affect the microbiota composition, with vaginally delivered infants’ microbiota containing a high abundance of lactobacilli during the ﬁrst few days, a reﬂection of the high load of lactobacilli in the vaginal ﬂora [26,27]. In contrast, the micro- biota of infants delivered by C-section is depleted and delayed in the colonisation of the Bacteroides genus, but colonised by facultative anaerobes such as Clostridium species [28,29]. Whilst the faecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles that of their mothers’ faecal microbiota, in babies delivered by C-section, this percentage is reduced to only 41% [30]. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]', '. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age. Facultative anaerobes are the first to colonize the gut at birth, and these bacteria create anaerobic conditions that promote the growth of obligate anaerobes, starting with Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp., within 2 weeks.47 Infants born naturally are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas those born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to the skin microbiota as well as the microbiome found in the environ- ment.48 At 3 days, infants who were naturally delivered possessed a greater abundance and variety of Bifidobacterium spp', '. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.

Colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal (GI) tract begins in early life and co-evolves concomitantly with the host throughout development and adult life. The content of the gut microbiota varies considerably from person to person, and is readily modified by changes in lifestyle, such as diet, smoking and exercise; yet collectively these diverse ecosystems have similar roles in maintaining homeostasis. Gut microorganisms are indispensable for the fermenta\xad tion of non-digestible carbohydrates, nutrient absorption and vitamin biosynthesis, as well as modulation of host immunity3. A dynamic but largely stable gut microbiota is believed to be ben\xad eficial for health', '. Gathering global microbiome data to understand unique microbial associations in dif- ferent regions and develop targeted therapeutics specific to the needs of each area is vital and requires large-scale collaboration between multiple research centres worldwide. It is evident from this Review that recent research highlights diet as a confounding factor in the interpretation of causal relationships between gut microorganisms and disease in clinical studies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive dietary metadata to generalize clinical findings for the advancement of microbiome-targeted therapies.

Multiple factors contribute to the establishment of the human gut microbiota during infancy. Diet is considered as one of the main drivers in shaping the gut microbiota across the life time. Intestinal bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Altered gut bac- terial composition (dysbiosis) has been associated with the pathogenesis of many inﬂam- matory diseases and infections', '. than the Caesarean-born babies.49,50 Moreover, babies who were solely breastfed until weaning were observed to generally have a more stable and less diverse bacterial community, with higher proportions of bifidobacteria than babies fed by formula milk.51−54 After being introduced to solid food, their gut microbiome diversified and the abundance of Firmicutes increased.54−56 The microbiomes of breastfed and formula-fed babies become indistinguishable by around 18 months of age. By the age of 3, their microbiomes resemble that of an adult.7,54 At old age, there is reportedly a decline in microbiota diversity, with reduced numbers of Bifidobacteria and an increase in Enter- obacteriaceae.57,58 Likewise, the abundance of Bacteroidetes increases, whereas the Firmicutes becomes less abundant in elderly adults (>65 years).59 Apart from age, gut microbiome composition is also greatly influenced by the environment in different anatomical locations', '. An unhealthy diet intake, such low intakes of fruits and vegetables intakes and overuse of antibiotics can result in dysbiosis. In nutshell, probiotics aid in the treatment of various infectious diseases, dysfunctions of the GI tract, and inﬂammatory disorders as well as in controlling obesity and diabetes. The advances in gut microbiota modeling and analysis will enhance our knowledge of how they inﬂuence health and disease, allowing us to adapt current and forthcoming therapeutic and preventive strategies.

This information is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to modify and shape the microbial community in disease. Development of the human GI microbiota The development of the microbiota is generally believed to begin from birth, although this dogma is challenged by a limited number of studies in which microbes were detected in womb tissues, such as the placenta [23,24].

Conversely, careful selection of variables to control often decreases the generalizability of the study (for example, successful prediction of microbiome outcomes may be confined to only preterm infants in the region or hospital under investigation). To generate models with higher predictive accuracy and breadth, it is important that future investigations into the compositional conse- quences of microbiome perturbation integrate extensive metadata on treatment, microbial and host variables, some of which are outlined in Table 1. Moreover, it is imperative to subject the resulting models to cross-cohort validation to determine the generalizability of the underlying predictors. Ameliorating perturbations The gastrointestinal tract requires a high, diverse microbial load to carry out requisite microbiome functions163. Thus, efforts towards the main- tenance or restoration of richness and diversity in the gut micro\xadbiome on antibiotic exposure are of extreme medical importance113,164,165', 'in the strong and reproducible enrichment of different bacterial species in the human gut [56]. Feeding methods can also affect the abundance of some bacterial groups in the gut microbiota of infants. For example, fucosylated oligosaccharides present in human milk can be utilised by Biﬁdobacterium longum and several species of Bacteroides allowing them to outcompete other bacteria such as E. coli and Clostridium perfringens [57,58]. Whilst the abundance of Biﬁdobacterium spp. in breast-fed infant microbiota is typically high [57], this is reduced in formula-fed infants [59]. Furthermore, formula-fed infant microbiota has an increased diversity and altered levels of other groups such as E. coli, Clostridium difﬁcile, Bacteroides fragilis and lactobacilli [59–61]. The microbiota of undernourished infants is immature, dysbiotic and contains greater numbers of enteropathogens, such as Enterobacteriaceae [62]', '. Sci. Rep. 5, 18563 (2015). 96. Keohane, D.

Although, in adulthood, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable, it is still subject to perturbation by life events [33].

The density and composition of the microbiota are affected by chemical, nutritional and immunological gradients along the gut. In the small intestine, there are typically high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials, and a short transit time [40]. These properties limit bacterial growth, such that only rapidly growing, facultative anaerobes with the ability to adhere to epithelia/ mucus are thought to survive [40]. In mice, the small-intestine microbial community is largely dominated by Lactobacillaceae [41]. In contrast, colonic conditions support a dense and diverse community of bacteria, mainly anaerobes with the ability to utilise complex carbohydrates which are undigested in the small intestine', '. After weaning there are noticeable changes in gut microbiota composition, primarily attributable to the altered diet composition. This results in an expansion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, which can metabolize more complex polysaccharides29.

However, at the age of 3, the gut microbiome changes to resemble that of the adult’s gut microbiome.7 As people reach beyond the age of 70, the ability to digest food and absorb nutrients in the gut changes, affecting the composition of the gut microbiome', 'filename': '6-Microbiome and Human Health.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.596, 'page_numbers': '[3]', 'title': 'Microbiome and Human Health: Current Understanding,'}, {'content': '. After birth, the GI tract is rapidly colonised, with life events such as illness, antibiotic treatment and changes in diet causing chaotic shifts in the microbiota [24,25]. The mode of delivery also appears to affect the microbiota composition, with vaginally delivered infants’ microbiota containing a high abundance of lactobacilli during the ﬁrst few days, a reﬂection of the high load of lactobacilli in the vaginal ﬂora [26,27]. In contrast, the micro- biota of infants delivered by C-section is depleted and delayed in the colonisation of the Bacteroides genus, but colonised by facultative anaerobes such as Clostridium species [28,29]. Whilst the faecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles that of their mothers’ faecal microbiota, in babies delivered by C-section, this percentage is reduced to only 41% [30]. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]', 'filename': '1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.5009, 'page_numbers': '[2]', 'title': 'Review Article'}, {'content': '. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age. Facultative anaerobes are the first to colonize the gut at birth, and these bacteria create anaerobic conditions that promote the growth of obligate anaerobes, starting with Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp., within 2 weeks.47 Infants born naturally are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas those born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to the skin microbiota as well as the microbiome found in the environ- ment.48 At 3 days, infants who were naturally delivered possessed a greater abundance and variety of Bifidobacterium spp', 'filename': '6-Microbiome and Human Health.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.4359, 'page_numbers': '[4]', 'title': 'Microbiome and Human Health: Current Understanding,'}, {'content': '. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.

However, it should also be noted that microbiotas that differ in terms of composition may share some degree of functional redundancy, yielding similar protein or metabolite proﬁles [22]. This information is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to modify and shape the microbial community in disease. Development of the human GI microbiota The development of the microbiota is generally believed to begin from birth, although this dogma is challenged by a limited number of studies in which microbes were detected in womb tissues, such as the placenta [23,24].

Conversely, careful selection of variables to control often decreases the generalizability of the study (for example, successful prediction of microbiome outcomes may be confined to only preterm infants in the region or hospital under investigation). To generate models with higher predictive accuracy and breadth, it is important that future investigations into the compositional conse- quences of microbiome perturbation integrate extensive metadata on treatment, microbial and host variables, some of which are outlined in Table 1. Moreover, it is imperative to subject the resulting models to cross-cohort validation to determine the generalizability of the underlying predictors. Ameliorating perturbations The gastrointestinal tract requires a high, diverse microbial load to carry out requisite microbiome functions163.

The density and composition of the microbiota are affected by chemical, nutritional and immunological gradients along the gut. In the small intestine, there are typically high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials, and a short transit time [40]. These properties limit bacterial growth, such that only rapidly growing, facultative anaerobes with the ability to adhere to epithelia/ mucus are thought to survive [40]. In mice, the small-intestine microbial community is largely dominated by Lactobacillaceae [41].

First, certain bacteria in the large intestine could convert bile acids to secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid (Allayee and Hazen, 2015). These secondary bile acids could be reabsorbed into the blood stream, function as signaling molecules and improve liver function and metabolic homeostasis (Thomas et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2014). The Firmicutes was known to be involved in bile acid metabolism and its abundance was positively associated with the content of secondary bile acids (Jones et al., 2008; Vrieze et al., 2014). We found that the reduced Firmicutes in the MDR-TB recovered group was correlated with the increased serum TC level.

Second, short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and butyrate were claimed to modulate lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues (Kimura et al., 2013). The genus Coprococcus is a major producer of butyrate (Rioscovian et al., 2016). In our work, the decreased Coprococcus was correlated with the increased TC level in the recovered group. Third, certain bacteria could produce trimethylamine (TMA) through the metabolism of dietary choline and L-carnitine. The generated TMA could be further metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide, which inhibits reverse cholesterol transportation and increases LDLC (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013). The gut bacterium responsible for TMA production is unclear. However, a strong correlation was previously reported between the blood TMA level and several gut taxa, including Prevotellaceae (Koeth et al., 2013). We observed a positive correlation between Prevotellaceae and the LDLC level', '. Addition- ally, gut microbiota varies in different anatomical parts of the GI tract. For example, Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are found in the small intestine but not the colon. Instead, Bacteriodetes such as Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenella- ceae are often found in the colon.19 Such variations are majorly due to the different environments. In the small intestine, the transit time is short and bile concentration is high, while in the colon, which has slower ﬂow rates and milder pH, as well as larger microbial communities, especially anaerobic types, are commonly observed.20 Besides spatial distribution, gut microbiota also differs by age', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 TABLE 1 Metabolites produced by gut microbiota and their functions.

Additionally, BCAA (for example, isoleu- cine, valine and leucine) fermentation results in the production of branched-chain fatty acids such as isobutyrate, 2-methyl butyrate and isovalerate60.

Bile acids Primary BAs, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in humans (and muricholic acid (MCA) in rodents), are amphipathic molecules synthesised in the liver from choles- terol.128 They can be conjugated to glycine or taurine prior to their secretion into bile and storage in the gallbladder. When food is ingested, BAs are released into the small intestine where they assist in the digestion and absorption of dietary fat. Around 95% of intestinal BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver for re-\xadsecretion. This enterohepatic circulation of BAs occurs several times a day and is an important physiological mechanism for maintaining whole body glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis to prevent hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity, and it protects against inflammatory metabolic diseases of the digestive and cardiovascular systems.129 Only a small frac- tion of the BAs will escape this highly efficient loop and reach the colon', '. Conversely, complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibres are non-\xaddigestible, meaning that the body lacks the necessary enzymes to digest them allowing them to escape digestion in the small intestine. In the colon, however, they can be used as an energy source by specific resident bacteria.

The GM can deconjugate Fig. 1 Microecological and physiological differences along the GI tract [103, 234]. Environmental conditions vary along the GI tract depend- ing on physical, nutritional, and biological host factors, which trans- late into adaptations and differences in the intestinal bacteria inhabit- ing the different regions and their physiological functions through multidirectional interactions that may affect glucose metabolism and diabetes risk. The main factors affecting the microbial load and com- position in the different regions are as follows. (1) pH values increase drastically from the stomach (pH 1.0–4.4) to the small intestine (pH 5.5–7.0) and then more progressively to the colon, where the pH can drop again (pH 5.5) as a consequence of the microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates (fibre). The pH increases again in faeces (up to pH 7.8)', '. Western diet The Western diet is characterized by a high calorie content and is enriched in animal protein, saturated fats, simple sugars and ultra- processed foods, with inadequate amounts of fibre, fruits and veg- etables. The Western diet is associated with a marked reduction in gut microbiome diversity compared to other diets, with a shift towards an enterosignature dominated by Bacteroides species71. Other enriched species belong to Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Blautia and Bilophila genera72–76. Because of the lower fibre input and the different microbial composition, the associated micro- biome produces less SCFA. Specific compounds from red meat, such as choline and carnitine, can also be transformed by the gut microbiome into trimethylamine, which is then converted in the liver to TMAO that is associated with chronic diseases', '. Interestingly, bile acids, particularly secondary ones, inﬂuence energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis via their eﬀects on gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity (Vrieze et al., 2014). Furthermore, steroid hormone biosynthesis and lipoic acid metabolism pathways were associated to NW subjects. Regulation of some key proteins in adipose tissues by sex steroid hormones may also be a mechanism for the treatment and/or prevention of obesity (Mayes and Watson, 2004). In addition, chronic administration of lipoic acid improves glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle glucose transport in the obese rat (Saengsirisuwan et al., 2004). Notably, the obese adolescent microbiome is signiﬁcantly enriched for KEGG pathways involved in the fructose and mannose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, galactose metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and pentose phosphate metabolism', '.

This ﬂexibility may be an advantageous feature of enlisting microbes as part of the digestive structure, particularly when considering the potential day-to-day variability in food available to foragers. It may also be an inescapable consequence of dealing with such a microbial community that is diverse and competitive and undergoes rapid turnover. Human gut microbiota is associated with the degradation of dietary ﬁbers, proteins, and peptides by fermentation and anaerobic degradation (Yadav et al., 2018). Carbohydrates and simple sugars are the main components of food metabolized by gut microbiota. Bacterial species, especially the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, can ferment ﬁbers (the indigestible carbohydrates) to produce branched- chain and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, ethanol, Frontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org', '. 2a).

Several mechanisms could explain the correlation between the elevated LDLC, TC and the altered gut microbiota taxa. First, certain bacteria in the large intestine could convert bile acids to secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid (Allayee and Hazen, 2015). These secondary bile acids could be reabsorbed into the blood stream, function as signaling molecules and improve liver function and metabolic homeostasis (Thomas et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2014). The Firmicutes was known to be involved in bile acid metabolism and its abundance was positively associated with the content of secondary bile acids (Jones et al., 2008; Vrieze et al., 2014). We found that the reduced Firmicutes in the MDR-TB recovered group was correlated with the increased serum TC level.

Second, short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and butyrate were claimed to modulate lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues (Kimura et al., 2013). The genus Coprococcus is a major producer of butyrate (Rioscovian et al., 2016). In our work, the decreased Coprococcus was correlated with the increased TC level in the recovered group. Third, certain bacteria could produce trimethylamine (TMA) through the metabolism of dietary choline and L-carnitine. The generated TMA could be further metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide, which inhibits reverse cholesterol transportation and increases LDLC (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013). The gut bacterium responsible for TMA production is unclear. However, a strong correlation was previously reported between the blood TMA level and several gut taxa, including Prevotellaceae (Koeth et al., 2013). We observed a positive correlation between Prevotellaceae and the LDLC level', 'filename': '21-Long-Term Effects of Multi-Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment on Gut Microbiota and Its Health Consequences.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': -0.0037, 'page_numbers': '[8]', 'title': 'ORIGINAL RESEARCH'}, {'content': '. Addition- ally, gut microbiota varies in different anatomical parts of the GI tract. For example, Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are found in the small intestine but not the colon. Instead, Bacteriodetes such as Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenella- ceae are often found in the colon.19 Such variations are majorly due to the different environments. In the small intestine, the transit time is short and bile concentration is high, while in the colon, which has slower ﬂow rates and milder pH, as well as larger microbial communities, especially anaerobic types, are commonly observed.20 Besides spatial distribution, gut microbiota also differs by age', 'filename': '5-Microbiota in health and diseases.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': -0.0085, 'page_numbers': '[2]', 'title': 'REVIEW ARTICLE'}, {'content': 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 TABLE 1 Metabolites produced by gut microbiota and their functions.

Bile acids Primary BAs, such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in humans (and muricholic acid (MCA) in rodents), are amphipathic molecules synthesised in the liver from choles- terol.128 They can be conjugated to glycine or taurine prior to their secretion into bile and storage in the gallbladder. When food is ingested, BAs are released into the small intestine where they assist in the digestion and absorption of dietary fat. Around 95% of intestinal BAs are reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver for re-\xadsecretion. This enterohepatic circulation of BAs occurs several times a day and is an important physiological mechanism for maintaining whole body glucose, lipid and energy homeostasis to prevent hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity, and it protects against inflammatory metabolic diseases of the digestive and cardiovascular systems.129 Only a small frac- tion of the BAs will escape this highly efficient loop and reach the colon', 'filename': '2-Gut microbiome and health- mechanistic insights.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': -0.0236, 'page_numbers': '[7]', 'title': 'Recent advances in basic science'}, {'content': '. Conversely, complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibres are non-\xaddigestible, meaning that the body lacks the necessary enzymes to digest them allowing them to escape digestion in the small intestine.

(1) pH values increase drastically from the stomach (pH 1.0–4.4) to the small intestine (pH 5.5–7.0) and then more progressively to the colon, where the pH can drop again (pH 5.5) as a consequence of the microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates (fibre).

Other enriched species belong to Ruminococcus, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Blautia and Bilophila genera72–76. Because of the lower fibre input and the different microbial composition, the associated micro- biome produces less SCFA.

This ﬂexibility may be an advantageous feature of enlisting microbes as part of the digestive structure, particularly when considering the potential day-to-day variability in food available to foragers. It may also be an inescapable consequence of dealing with such a microbial community that is diverse and competitive and undergoes rapid turnover. Human gut microbiota is associated with the degradation of dietary ﬁbers, proteins, and peptides by fermentation and anaerobic degradation (Yadav et al., 2018). Carbohydrates and simple sugars are the main components of food metabolized by gut microbiota.

gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis",hard,mechanism,"Butyrate plays a multifaceted and essential role in maintaining intestinal health, acting as a primary energy source, a regulator of the microbial environment, and a modulator of the immune system.

**Primary Energy Source and Barrier Function**
*   **Colonocyte Fuel:** Butyrate is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes.
*   **Gut Barrier Integrity:** It enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and stimulating mucin synthesis. It also regulates intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting cell proliferation at the bottom of crypts while increasing apoptosis of cells closer to the lumen.

**Maintenance of the Anaerobic Environment**
*   **Oxygen Regulation:** Butyrate is critical for maintaining the anaerobic conditions of the colon. It activates $\beta$-oxidation in the mitochondria of colonocytes, a process that consumes oxygen.
*   **PPAR$\gamma$ Activation:** By activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR$\gamma$), butyrate limits the diffusion of oxygen from colonocytes into the lumen. This prevents the expansion of facultative anaerobes, such as *Enterobacteriaceae*, which are associated with intestinal inflammation.

**Anti-Inflammatory and Immune Modulation**
*   **Immune Cell Regulation:** Butyrate stimulates the differentiation and activity of regulatory T cells (Treg), which help limit inflammatory responses in the intestine.
*   **Nitric Oxide Reduction:** It binds to PPAR$\gamma$ to repress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thereby decreasing the production of nitric oxide and nitrates, which otherwise could be used by specific pathogens.

**Anticancer Activities**
*   **Differential Effects:** Butyrate exhibits different effects on normal versus cancerous colonocytes. In cancer cells, it is metabolized less efficiently, leading it to accumulate and act as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.
*   **Apoptosis:** This inhibition of HDAC allows butyrate to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) and inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells.

**Metabolic Health**
*   **Hormone Stimulation:** Butyrate stimulates the secretion of satiety hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), from enteroendocrine cells.
*   **Metabolic Regulation:** It is associated with regulated appetite, decreased insulin resistance, and promoted fat oxidation, suggesting therapeutic potential for obesity and diabetes.","['. However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells. Indeed, the abundance of oxygen in the luminal part of the gut and its gradually decreasing concentration towards the epithe- lium is a key requirement for anaerobic bacteria to remain in the close vicinity of the epithelium as opposed to facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) that have been shown to increase the risk of intestinal inflam- mation (figure 3).80 81 Butyrate contributes to control of the anaerobic condition in the colon by activating the β-oxidation in the mitochondria. By activating the nuclear receptor peroxi- some proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the colonic cells, butyrate limits the diffusion of oxygen from the colonocytes to the luminal part, thereby maintaining the anaer- obic conditions', '. Belcheva et al. suggested that supplementation with prebiotic/butyrate could promote tumor progression due to genetic variation in individuals.345 Their ﬁndings suggest that butyrate functions as an oncometabolite, while a substantial of studies reported butyrate as tumor suppressive metabolite. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes', '. Butyrate also binds to peroxisome proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which in turn repress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), decreases nitric oxide production (NO) and eventually nitrate production. Conversely, in pathological situations low butyrate content in the lumen is associated with lower PPARγ activity, increased glycolysis and lower oxygen consumption. This is associated with a higher expression of iNOS which in turn produces more NO and eventually increases nitrates availability for specific pathogens. Butyrate can also stimulate immune cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg) to reduce inflammation. The nuclear transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is highly expressed and activated in healthy colonocytes, whereas agonists of AhR are lower or reduced AhR activity can lead to altered gut barrier function', '. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes. In colon cancer cells, butyrate is metabolized to a lesser extent compared to normal cells, thereby accumulating as HDAC inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis.346 The difference observed in this study may lay between host genetic back- ground, the age, and the presence of other bacterial 853 North America 69 South America 1332 Europe 662 Asia 56 Africa 13 Pacifica 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Allergy Cancer Diabetes Related C.Difficile Infection Heart Disease HIV Inflammatory Bowel Disorders Liver Cirrhosis Mental Disease Neural Disease Obesity Other Bowel Disorders Other Infections Other Inflammatory Disease Early Phase 1 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Clinical trials related to microbiota a b c d Cancer Response No response Response No response Response No response C.Difficile Infection Inflammatory Bowel Disorders 331 210 315 124 92 25 Fig', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 FIGURE 2 Positive health outcomes of gut microbial eubiosis. hydrogen, and carbon dioxide; these products are further used by the host or excreted (Patrascu et al., 2017). Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) distinguished in human feces, usually found in 3:1:1 to 10:2:1 molar ratio; this ratio is consistent with the values reported in the intestine in early sudden deaths (Rowland et al., 2018). These are the main SCFAs that perform several essential functions in the human body (Rauf et al., 2022). Butyrate is perhaps the essential SCFA for human health, as it is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes (Wang et al., 2019).

In one study, a high-fibre diet improved glucose toler- ance in individuals with type 2 diabetes, an effect that was associated with increased faecal butyrate levels and circu- lating GLP-1 [59]. GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion, promoting insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatic glucose production (Fig. 1). Additionally, SCFAs are crucial for maintaining overall gut health and the gut barrier, as butyrate is the primary fuel source for colonocytes. In contrast, reduced butyrate drives colonocytes toward anaerobic glycolysis, which increases epithelial oxygenation, disrupting the anaerobic environment of the colon [126]', '.

The Local Beneﬁcial Effect of Fiber Intake IBD and CRC The incidence of IBD is increasing in occidental countries, and the Westernization of the diet and lower gut bacterial diversity, especially reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria, have been suggested to contribute to increased IBD prevalence (Ott and Schreiber, 2006). In agreement, low ﬁber intake is correlated with increased incidence of Crohn’s disease (Hou et al., 2011) and exacerbates colitis in mice. By investigating the effect of 40 deﬁned diets in mice, Llewellyn et al. demonstrated that dietary protein and ﬁbers had negative and beneﬁcial effects on colitis development, respectively. Similarly, mice developed DSS-induced colitis proportional to the amount of ﬁbers in the diet (Macia et al., 2015). The preventive effect of ﬁbers may be due to increased cecal SCFA levels, especially butyrate, which is known to have anti-inﬂammatory properties, potentially through GPR43 (Maslowski et al., 2009)', '. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]. The role of SCFAs on human metabolism has recently been reviewed [140,143]. Butyrate is known for its anti-inﬂammatory and anticancer activities [140,143]. Butyrate is a particularly important energy source for colonocytes [138]. A decreasing gradient of butyrate from lumen to crypt is suggested to control intestinal epithelial turnover and homeostasis by promoting colonocyte proliferation at the bottom of crypts, whilst increasing apoptosis and exfoliation of cells closer to the lumen [144]. Butyrate can attenuate bacterial translocation and enhance gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis [140]. SCFAs also appear to regulate hepatic lipid and glucose homeostasis via complementary mechanisms', 'intestinal barrier integrity and reducing colon cancer risk.331 SCFAs, particularly butyrate, are also able to regulate appetite, decrease insulin resistance, promote fat oxidation, and stimulate the release of insulinotropic hormones.332,333 Due to these effects on host metabolic activity, butyrate is likely to have a therapeutic effect on patients with obesity and diabetes. Oral delivery of butyrate is challenging due to its poor bioavailability and disagreeable odor and taste. Thus, different bacteria have been metabolically engineered to produce butyrate in the gut as an alternative treatment for obesity and diabetes. Bacillus subtilis SCK6 naturally produces butyrate at very low levels and thus was engineered to produce butyrate via the butyryl CoA:acetic acid CoA transferase pathway that is present in the gut’s butyrogenic microbes.334 Further deletion of competing metabolic pathways yielded a strain that can produce 1.5 g/L of butyrate in vitro', '. However, such high doses of inulin would most likely not be tolerated in humans (Figure 1). An important recent discovery from the B€aumler lab demon- strated that beta-oxidation of butyrate by colonocytes con- sumes oxygen and results in an anaerobic milieu in the gut (Byndloss et al., 2017). Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced further, lowering the amount of butyrate production. This feedforward loop results in increased luminal oxygen levels, allowing Proteo- bacteria such as Escherichia coli and S. enterica serovar Typhi- murium to bloom. This novel mechanism provides not only an explanation for many of the pathologies associated with a low-ﬁ- ber diet, but also a mechanistic understanding for why reduced microbial diversity is observed in both humans and mice on a low-ﬁber diet.

Bonﬁli, L. et al', '. Food components such as animal protein, dairy, carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 3a) have been linked to the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease130. One proposed mechanism connecting inflamma- tory bowel disease to animal proteins involves amino acid and haem malabsorption in the small intestine, resulting in the production of harmful by-products such as phenol and hydrogen. This contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting butyrate production and reducing disulfide bridges in the intestinal barrier131. Diets rich in fat are also strongly associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. In experimental models, a high-fat diet can disrupt binding protein functionality among enterocytes, thereby altering the composition of the mucous layer and the intestinal microbiota132 (Box 1)', '.

Previous research demonstrated that propionic and butyric acids contribute to colonic and peripheral Treg cell differentiation in mouse intestines through activation of the GPR43 fatty acid receptor111,112. Moreover, dietary fibre supplementation substantially elevates intestinal SCFA levels. Several ongoing clinical trials are exploring the potential of dietary interventions or fermentable fibre supple- mentation to modulate intestinal SCFA concentrations and alleviate symptoms of IBD. In mice, butyrate contributes to differentiation of Treg cells113, which play a role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine114. Treg cell differentiation occurred via an extrathymic pathway dependent on CNS1, an intronic enhancer required for extrathymic but not thymic differentiation113. Propionate was also able to promote Treg cell differen- tiation, indicating that bacterial metabolites can mediate the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cells in the gut113', '. These receptors, named G protein-\xadcoupled receptor (GPR)43 (or free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)) and GPR41 (or FFAR3) (figure 4),73 are also expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types (eg, adipocytes, immune cells).74–76 The key role played by the microbiome on the secretion of the gut peptides has been elucidated by using mouse models lacking either GPR43 or GPR41. Mice lacking these receptors exhibit reduced secretion of GLP-\xad1 and PYY after exposure to SCFAs or specific prebiotics (figure 3).77–79 In addition to their well-\xadknown role and mechanisms of action, some SCFAs might also exert different functions from what has previously been thought. For example, butyrate has been described many times as an essential energy source for the colonic cells to proliferate and maintain the gut barrier. However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells', '. A recent analysis demonstrated that microbial acetyl- transferases presence was correlated with an elevated risk of treat- ment failure when using 5-aminosalicylic acid, suggesting another mechanism through which gut microbiota affects IBD treatment and response196. The gut microbiome also appears to regulate the efficacy of response to sulfasalazine, a prodrug used to treat IBD-associated peripheral spondyloarthritis. Patients who demonstrated a clinical response to sulfasalazine had a gut microbiome enriched in F. praus- nitzii and levels of butyrate were elevated in the gut. In mice colonized with microbiota from responders, sulfasalazine was able to increase faecal butyrate levels and limit colitis, indicating the role of the microbiome in determining response to therapy197', '.

However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells. Indeed, the abundance of oxygen in the luminal part of the gut and its gradually decreasing concentration towards the epithe- lium is a key requirement for anaerobic bacteria to remain in the close vicinity of the epithelium as opposed to facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) that have been shown to increase the risk of intestinal inflam- mation (figure 3).80 81 Butyrate contributes to control of the anaerobic condition in the colon by activating the β-oxidation in the mitochondria. By activating the nuclear receptor peroxi- some proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the colonic cells, butyrate limits the diffusion of oxygen from the colonocytes to the luminal part, thereby maintaining the anaer- obic conditions', 'filename': '2-Gut microbiome and health- mechanistic insights.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.4271, 'page_numbers': '[5]', 'title': 'Recent advances in basic science'}, {'content': '.

Butyrate also binds to peroxisome proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which in turn repress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), decreases nitric oxide production (NO) and eventually nitrate production. Conversely, in pathological situations low butyrate content in the lumen is associated with lower PPARγ activity, increased glycolysis and lower oxygen consumption. This is associated with a higher expression of iNOS which in turn produces more NO and eventually increases nitrates availability for specific pathogens. Butyrate can also stimulate immune cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg) to reduce inflammation.

Butyrate is perhaps the essential SCFA for human health, as it is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes (Wang et al., 2019).

Food components such as animal protein, dairy, carbohydrates and polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 3a) have been linked to the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease130. One proposed mechanism connecting inflamma- tory bowel disease to animal proteins involves amino acid and haem malabsorption in the small intestine, resulting in the production of harmful by-products such as phenol and hydrogen. This contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting butyrate production and reducing disulfide bridges in the intestinal barrier131. Diets rich in fat are also strongly associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease. In experimental models, a high-fat diet can disrupt binding protein functionality among enterocytes, thereby altering the composition of the mucous layer and the intestinal microbiota132 (Box 1)', 'filename': '4-The interplay between diet and the gut microbiome.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.1368, 'page_numbers': '[11]', 'title': 'nature reviews'}, {'content': '.

Previous research demonstrated that propionic and butyric acids contribute to colonic and peripheral Treg cell differentiation in mouse intestines through activation of the GPR43 fatty acid receptor111,112. Moreover, dietary fibre supplementation substantially elevates intestinal SCFA levels. Several ongoing clinical trials are exploring the potential of dietary interventions or fermentable fibre supple- mentation to modulate intestinal SCFA concentrations and alleviate symptoms of IBD. In mice, butyrate contributes to differentiation of Treg cells113, which play a role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine114. Treg cell differentiation occurred via an extrathymic pathway dependent on CNS1, an intronic enhancer required for extrathymic but not thymic differentiation113. Propionate was also able to promote Treg cell differen- tiation, indicating that bacterial metabolites can mediate the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cells in the gut113', 'filename': '11-Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.1237, 'page_numbers': '[7]', 'title': 'nature reviews'}, {'content': '. These receptors, named G protein-\xadcoupled receptor (GPR)43 (or free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)) and GPR41 (or FFAR3) (figure 4),73 are also expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types (eg, adipocytes, immune cells).74–76 The key role played by the microbiome on the secretion of the gut peptides has been elucidated by using mouse models lacking either GPR43 or GPR41. Mice lacking these receptors exhibit reduced secretion of GLP-\xad1 and PYY after exposure to SCFAs or specific prebiotics (figure 3).77–79 In addition to their well-\xadknown role and mechanisms of action, some SCFAs might also exert different functions from what has previously been thought. For example, butyrate has been described many times as an essential energy source for the colonic cells to proliferate and maintain the gut barrier. However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells', 'filename': '2-Gut microbiome and health- mechanistic insights.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.1149, 'page_numbers': '[5]', 'title': 'Recent advances in basic science'}, {'content': '. A recent analysis demonstrated that microbial acetyl- transferases presence was correlated with an elevated risk of treat- ment failure when using 5-aminosalicylic acid, suggesting another mechanism through which gut microbiota affects IBD treatment and response196. The gut microbiome also appears to regulate the efficacy of response to sulfasalazine, a prodrug used to treat IBD-associated peripheral spondyloarthritis. Patients who demonstrated a clinical response to sulfasalazine had a gut microbiome enriched in F. praus- nitzii and levels of butyrate were elevated in the gut. In mice colonized with microbiota from responders, sulfasalazine was able to increase faecal butyrate levels and limit colitis, indicating the role of the microbiome in determining response to therapy197', 'filename': '11-Microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.1146, 'page_numbers': '[12]', 'title': 'nature reviews'}, {'content': '.
