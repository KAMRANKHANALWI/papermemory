This was consistent with KEGG Orthology Enrichment Analysis showing significant increase in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are indispensable for protein synthesis, recent studies indicate their biological functions extend beyond translation. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila secretes seryl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS), which modulates immune homeostasis and facilitates production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. These findings suggest ARSs from gut microbiota may influence host immune response and regulate gut homeostasis, representing a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD",

When species and KO genes were combined, diagnostic performance showed AUROC > 0.97 in Renji cohort and > 0.9 in USA-NL cohort. Combining species and metabolites showed the best performance among paired combinations, generally achieving AUROC > 0.9.
