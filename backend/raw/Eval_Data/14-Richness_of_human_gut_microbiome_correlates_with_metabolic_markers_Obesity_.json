The study suggests that low-grade inflammation associated with a plethora of chronic diseases may share a common feature of low gut bacterial richness. The LGC phenotype includes features that bring individuals at increased risk of pre-diabetes, type-2 diabetes and ischaemic cardiovascular disorders.
