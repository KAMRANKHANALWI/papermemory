      "ground_truth_answer": "Butyrate maintains anaerobic conditions by activating beta-oxidation in colonocyte mitochondria, which consumes oxygen. It also activates PPARγ in colonic cells, which represses inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, reducing NO and nitrate production. This prevents facultative anaerobes like Enterobacteriaceae from proliferating, as increased nitrate availability favors pathogenic bacteria that can cause inflammation",

      "ground_truth_answer": "During obesity and diabetes, the intestinal endocannabinoid system is altered with increased abundance of anandamide (AEA) that triggers gut permeability via CB1-dependent mechanisms. This modification is associated with changes in gut microbiota. Pharmacological activation of the eCB system can increase adipogenesis and disrupt the gut barrier",

Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid are formed when gut microbes modify primary bile acids through deconjugation, dehydroxylation, oxidation or epimerization",

It's linked to energy metabolism and metabolic syndrome. Studies show reduced capacity to metabolize tryptophan into AhR-binding derivatives in metabolic syndrome. Administration of Lactobacillus strains producing AhR ligands improved metabolic functions, ameliorated intestinal barrier, and reduced hepatic steatosis",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Enterosynes are molecules originating from the gut which have the capacity to modulate duodenal contraction by targeting the enteric nervous system. In type 2 diabetes, duodenal hypermotility creates aberrant afferent nervous messages to the brain. Restoring natural duodenal contraction by acting on ENS neurons can restore the gut-brain axis and improve insulin sensitivity. For example, oligofructose increases 12-HETE which acts through mu-opioid receptors and PPARγ to improve glucose metabolism",

Deletion in adipocytes causes spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance and microbiota shifts. Deletion in intestinal epithelial cells causes hyperphagia, exacerbated obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hypothalamic alterations. Deletion in hepatocytes causes high-fat diet-like phenotype on normal diet with changes in bile acids. All deletions profoundly affect gut microbiota composition",

Fructoselysine, a primary dietary AGE formed from lysine and glucose, can be converted into butyrate by Intestinimonas species via a novel pathway. Another major AGE, N-ε-carboxymethyllysine, can be completely utilized by Cloacibacillus and potentially Oscillibacter species.
