The initial treatment group experienced a substantial rise in IL-10 levels, while the retreatment group witnessed a significant increase in IL-2 levels. The IL-6 increase in the retreatment group suggests disease severity correlation. The IL-10 increase in early TB indicates it inhibited rapid MTB replication and played a protective role. Low IL-2 suggests insufficient secretion prevented the body from completely clearing MTB, leading to active TB or relapse",
