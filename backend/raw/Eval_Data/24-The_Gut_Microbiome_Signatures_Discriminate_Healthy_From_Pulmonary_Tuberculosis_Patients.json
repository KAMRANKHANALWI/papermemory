While it's likely these changes were caused by M. tuberculosis infection based on similar results in murine models, the possibility that dysbiosis precedes and contributes to infection cannot be excluded. Additionally, as only TB patients and healthy controls were included, it's unclear if the gut bacteria and suggested model can discriminate TB patients from other non-TB patients. To be a potential diagnostic method, the accuracy and specificity should be validated in large-scale sampling studies. Finally, the findings were observed in active TB infection; the gut microbiota signature in latent TB infection still needs investigation",
