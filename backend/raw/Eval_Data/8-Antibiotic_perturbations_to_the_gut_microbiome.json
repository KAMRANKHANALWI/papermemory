These mice displayed immunological symptoms of pre-inflammatory bowel disease, probably due to the combined metabolic influence of the high-fat diet on gut epithelial cells and changes in microbiome structure. Such synergistic interventions free up simple sugars and ethanolamines through altered fatty acid metabolism, ultimately increasing susceptibility to enteric infection",

      "ground_truth_answer": "In the short term, the increase in resistome burden after antibiotic treatment is primarily driven by the enrichment of chromosomally encoded ARGs (that is, the expansion of resistant bacterial lineages). However, the abundance of microorganisms with chromosomal ARGs declines sharply shortly thereafter (approximately 1 month). Conversely, MGE-encoded ARGs persist for longer periods after therapy cessation, probably due to the parasitic nature of MGEs (their persistence among bacterial populations despite the absence of antibiotic-mediated growth advantages or presence of fitness defects conferred on the bacterial host)",

Paradoxically, of the two drugs, vancomycin has a narrower in vitro spectrum of activity. Vancomycin significantly decreased the relative abundance of Coprococcus eutactus, F. prausnitzii and Anaerostipes caccae (SCFA-producing Firmicutes), while increasing the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. Three different mouse models have reproduced the superior capacity of vancomycin to decrease alpha diversity or increase pathogen susceptibility compared to more than five other antibiotic agents",

DAV132 can adsorb antibiotics belonging to six drug classes ex vivo. Coadministration of DAV132 with antibiotics protects gut bacterial richness and diversity, impedes the spread of pathobionts and resistant organisms, and maintains the colonization resistance capacity of the gut against C. difficile. DAV132 can be further modified to achieve site-specific inactivation: coating of the adsorbent in a pH-dependent polymer ensures its release and activity in the colon, without compromising the antibiotic activity in the small intestine",

Notably, TEM1 was designed to be expressed by two gene segments as two enzymatically inactive components that reconstitute the functional enzyme on secretion: this split nature of the gene minimizes the risk of its spread through HGT. Similarly, probiotic E. coli was engineered to sense extracellular sialic acid (a proxy for gut dysbiosis) and respond by producing a bile salt hydrolase, deconjugating primary bile salts in the gut, which reduced germination of C. difficile endospores",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Short-read metagenome assemblies are highly fragmented and cannot be used for identification of genetic origins (chromosome versus plasmid) and taxonomic origins of ARGs. The relatively short length of assembled contigs makes it impractical to determine the genomic origins of these contigs. Many assembled contigs, particularly those corresponding to mobile genetic elements, remain unbinned, obscuring their taxonomic origins. Additionally, because of the total DNA extraction step that typically precedes sequencing library preparation, shotgun metagenomic sequencing does not enable efficient linking of MGEs with bacterial hosts, obscuring community HGT dynamics. These limitations can be addressed through long-read sequencing and Hi-C platforms, which preserve information regarding MGE-bacterial host associations",

In humans, volunteers fed omnivore and vegan diets during combination antibiotic treatment displayed an expedited microbiome recovery (as measured by alpha and beta diversity) relative to those on a fibre-free liquid diet. Specifically, fibre-containing diets encouraged a rapid restoration of stool butyrate levels and a return of Firmicutes with distinct amino acid metabolism. This demonstrates that modulation of polysaccharide or microbiota-accessible carbohydrate levels in diet is highly influential over antibiotic treatment outcomes",
