This was consistent with KEGG Orthology Enrichment Analysis showing significant increase in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are indispensable for protein synthesis, recent studies indicate their biological functions extend beyond translation. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila secretes seryl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS), which modulates immune homeostasis and facilitates production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. These findings suggest ARSs from gut microbiota may influence host immune response and regulate gut homeostasis, representing a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD",

The microbiota can modulate gut-extrinsic EANs - depletion of gut microbiome resulted in increased cFos expression (a neuronal activity marker), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Specific bacterial species and their metabolites (SCFAs, bile acids, GLP-1, peptide YY) modulate sympathetic activity and activate brainstem sensory nuclei. TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, which also regulate microbiota composition. Microbial metabolites can regulate activation of brainstem sensory nuclei with polysynaptic connections to the intestine, establishing a gut-brain-gut axis. Additionally, the presence of microbial communities induces AHR expression in EANs, which activates genes regulating neuronal excitability and results in increased intestinal peristaltic activity.",

The annual incidence of CD was 3.2 cases per million from 1983 to 1992, rising to 16.6 cases per million from 1993 to 2002. This increase parallels significant changes in industrialization and lifestyle over the last four decades, which greatly impacted dietary and sedentary behaviors.

Items are rated along a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none\/nothing or symptom does not occur) to 3 (very frequent and troublesome symptom), with patients graded based on degree, frequency, duration, mitigating factors, and impact on social activities",

    "reference":"The gut-lung axis refers to the bidirectional relationship where the gut microbiota can influence respiratory diseases and vice versa. Intestinal disorders may affect the lungs through lung inflammation, as both have similar immune messengers and inflammatory processes. The relationship between gut microbiota and respiratory diseases may be related to classic immune inflammatory pathways such as the T cell family and pattern recognition receptors. TNF-\u03b1, inflammatory factors such as IL-22 and their regulatory substances constitute the common substance of the intestinal lung axis, which may be related to drug resistance. Intestinal microbiota can regulate the immune response of lung tissue through SCFAs, cytokines, and other factors, thereby affecting the development and outcome of lung diseases including tuberculosis",

This is significant because bacteria within the Bacteroidota phylum are capable of utilizing dietary fibers to produce SCFAs, which are crucial for colonocyte energy, immune regulation, and inflammatory response.

This is clinically concerning because while Enterococcus can enhance gastrointestinal adhesion by producing extracellular polysaccharides and facilitate probiotic colonization, in tuberculosis patients undergoing long-term antibiotic therapy or with compromised immunity, Enterococcus are prone to translocation leading to enterococcal infections. Moreover, their ability to accumulate mutations and acquire exogenous genetic elements confers additional antibiotic resistance, rendering Enterococcus as one of the major nosocomial pathogens, suggesting potential drug resistance or pathogenic risk",

The MDR-TB treatment represents an unprecedented disturbance - none of the previously studied antibiotic treatments has comparable impact. The new equilibrium is driven by both direct effects (elimination of certain bacterial species by antibiotics) and indirect effects (loss of autotrophic bacteria that rely on fermentation products of eliminated bacteria, or competitive bacteria that previously competed with eliminated bacteria). The network analysis also suggested close correlations among bacterial genera, meaning elimination of some species affects others",

Nine beneficial pathways enriched in M5-low included: Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, thiamine diphosphate salvage II (P=0.0087), thiamine diphosphate biosynthesis I, flavin biosynthesis I, preQ0 biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Six detrimental pathways depleted in M5-low included: glycogen degradation I, glycolysis I and II, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside salvage, and L-histidine degradation I (P=0.032). The thiamine salvage pathway showed taxonomic contribution from various bacterial families forming a beneficial consortium, while detrimental pathways were mainly from Bacteroidaceae. Both pathways correlated with CD8+ T cell numbers in tumor epithelium",

In some disease states, increased airway wall permeability and mucus production introduce nutrient supply to the normally sparse lung environment. The mucus introduces pockets of increased temperature and decreased oxygen tension, selectively favoring the growth of disease-associated microbes. Enhanced immunogenicity exposes airways and alveoli to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and microbial metabolites that provoke further inflammation, which in turn further alters airway conditions. The generation of intraalveolar catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines promotes the growth of select bacterial species such as P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia complex, whereas the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells kills and clears bacteria with variable, species-specific effectiveness.

The beneficial interplay of the host and its microbiome is responsible for maintaining the host's health, whereas disease development is often correlated with microbial dysbiosis or a shift in the microbiota. Pathogens represent only a tiny fraction of microorganisms, whereby the altered composition of the microbiome promotes the emergence and outbreak of pathogens. The vast majority of microbes are crucial for ecosystem functioning as well as beneficial interactions with other microbes, contributing to population dynamics and functional activities. Thus, opportunistic pathogens show that host-microbe interactions depend not only on the host but also on the entire microbiome.

Mode of delivery and feeding method (breastfeeding vs formula) significantly affect initial colonization. By age 3, the microbiome resembles that of adults. In prepubescent children, increased hormones during puberty stimulate sebaceous glands, favoring growth of lipophilic microorganisms like Propionibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., and fungal Malassezia spp. This relates to disease susceptibility, with atopic dermatitis related to Staphylococcus more common in prepubescent children, while Malassezia-related tinea versicolor is more prominent in adults. In old age (>65 years), there is a decline in microbiota diversity with reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of Bacteroidetes increases while Firmicutes becomes less abundant. Decreased immune activity makes elderly adults more susceptible to pathogens.

Additionally, because of the total DNA extraction step that typically precedes sequencing library preparation, shotgun metagenomic sequencing does not enable efficient linking of MGEs with bacterial hosts, obscuring community HGT dynamics.

This paradoxical finding may be explained by several factors: (1) therapy being taken by patients may introduce additional metabolites, (2) excessive bacterial growth in IBD provokes secretion of numerous volatile components, (3) treatment-derived xenobiotic metabolites significantly contribute to observed metabolic signatures. While patients with IBD typically have reduced microbiota diversity (which should result in fewer identified metabolites), the overall spectrum of detectable metabolites is actually larger due to these additional factors. In contrast, adults with chronic IBD demonstrate a more stable metabolomic profile reflecting long-term adaptation to disease. This suggests the wide variety of components in pediatric IBD patients reflects acute dysbiosis and therapeutic intervention rather than adaptive microbiome changes",
