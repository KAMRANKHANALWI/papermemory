multiomics_ibd_013,Explain how the K22477 gene deficiency contributes to IBD symptoms through glutamate metabolism,"K22477 (argO, N-acetylglutamate synthase) is responsible for producing N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-CoA. The study revealed that IBD patients have reduced levels of K22477, leading to an excess of L-glutamate. This overabundance of L-glutamate can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in IBD patients. This finding highlights how impaired gut microbial biotransformation, resulting from substantial reduction in the gut commensal community, contributes to disease pathology",10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf,['10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,95,508
multiomics_ibd_014,Describe the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets,"The study identified four genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis enzymes within the symbiotic bacterial community: K09759 (aspS, nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), K01870 (ileS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase), K01892 (hisS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase), and K01873 (valS, valyl-tRNA synthetase). This was consistent with KEGG Orthology Enrichment Analysis showing significant increase in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are indispensable for protein synthesis, recent studies indicate their biological functions extend beyond translation. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila secretes seryl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS), which modulates immune homeostasis and facilitates production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. These findings suggest ARSs from gut microbiota may influence host immune response and regulate gut homeostasis, representing a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD",10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf,['10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,97,953

When species and KO genes were combined, diagnostic performance showed AUROC > 0.97 in Renji cohort and > 0.9 in USA-NL cohort. Combining species and metabolites showed the best performance among paired combinations, generally achieving AUROC > 0.9. The integration of all three panels (species, KO genes, and metabolites) significantly enhanced diagnostic performance: In Renji cohort, 10-fold cross-validation achieved AUROC of 0.98 with independent validation reaching 0.96; in USA-NL cohorts, 10-fold cross-validation reached 0.93 with independent validation at 0.92. This represents a significant improvement over previous non-invasive diagnostic models and demonstrates that combining diverse omics data substantially enhances machine learning model performance for IBD diagnosis",10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf,['10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,112,896

ibd_microbiota_006,Explain how short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and Treg cell differentiation,"SCFAs such as acetate, propionate and butyrate are synthesized via gut microbial fermentation of dietary fibers and are pivotal in sustaining intestinal homeostasis. Propionic and butyric acids contribute to colonic and peripheral Treg cell differentiation through activation of the GPR43 fatty acid receptor. Butyrate contributes to Treg cell differentiation via an extrathymic pathway dependent on CNS1, an intronic enhancer. SCFAs also act through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition to induce Treg cells, which play a role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,110,581

IsoalloLCA enhances Treg cell differentiation by binding to nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) and increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. Treg cells induced by isoalloLCA suppress inflammation in colitis models. In individuals with Crohn's disease, levels of 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA were decreased, and upregulated genes associated with TH17 cells and IL-17 in IBD patients were found to have negative correlation with these secondary bile acids.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,112,586
ibd_microbiota_008,How does adherent-invasive Escherichia coli contribute to intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease?,"Adherent-invasive E. coli, which is enriched in individuals with Crohn's disease, promotes intestinal inflammation through propanediol dehydratase-dependent production of propionate and modulation of IL-1β-producing CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes. During IBD, the loss of intestinal hypoxia allows E. coli, a facultative anaerobe, to use reactive oxygen and nitrogen by-products for anaerobic respiration to grow and outcompete gut commensals.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,101,443
ibd_microbiota_009,What role does the CARD9 gene variant play in fungal immunity and IBD susceptibility?,CARD9 is a critical mediator of systemic antifungal IgG antibody responses to C. albicans and plays a role in CARD9-dependent tuning of the human antibody repertoire. A certain risk variant (S12N; rs4077515) of CARD9 fosters greater TNF and IL-6 production by dendritic cells upon stimulation with depleted zymosan or whole yeast cells. The protective variant (S12NΔ11; rs141992399) leads to attenuated pro-inflammatory signalling through impaired interaction with the ubiquitin ligase TRIM62 upon stimulation with fungal cell wall ligands. Loss-of-function mutation in CX3CR1 in individuals with CD was associated with impaired antifungal antibody responses.,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,85,659

On the pathogenic side, perturbations of the B cell compartment with expansion of bacteria-reactive IgG+ plasma cells have been described in IBD, and B cell-associated pathology in CD involves cytotoxic T cells with specificity to gut fungal antigens, which are enriched in individuals with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. On the protective side, B cells produce secretory IgA, the most abundant immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents direct contact between luminal factors (including bacteria) and intestinal epithelial cells. Secretory IgA can also target fungi with high affinity for fungal hyphae, and gut fungi such as C. albicans induce IgA class switch recombination or activate antibody production systemically.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,72,804
ibd_microbiota_011,Describe how autophagy proteins and ATG16L1 variants affect Paneth cell function and intestinal inflammation,"Defects in autophagy and loss-of-function mutations in autophagy genes are well-documented drivers of IBD. Polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes such as ATG16L1 are strongly associated with both UC and CD. Autophagy proteins prevent intestinal inflammation by supporting Paneth cell homeostasis and viability, controlling endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, and secreting antimicrobial proteins to reinforce intestinal epithelial barrier function. Individuals with variants in ATG16L1 and NOD2 show defective Treg cell responses to outer membrane vesicles delivered by Bacteroides fragilis. Mice with Atg16l1 variants associated with increased CD risk exhibit structural abnormalities in Paneth cells following murine norovirus infection. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 produced by γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes protects Paneth cells from death during intestinal inflammation in both mice and humans carrying the ATG16L1 IBD risk allele.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,108,935
ibd_microbiota_012,Compare the efficacy and mechanisms of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,"FMT has shown modest effects in ulcerative colitis but limited data exists for Crohn's disease. In UC, randomized controlled trials demonstrated remission rates of 24–53%, with four out of five trials showing statistically significant benefit. Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium hallii enrichment, along with increased faecal SCFAs, was associated with remission, whereas increases in Escherichia spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Candida spp. were associated with lack of response. Increased Candida spp. abundance pre-FMT was associated with clinical response, while decreased Candida spp. abundance post-FMT indicated ameliorated disease severity. Both donor material and recipient-specific factors including engraftment play a part in response, with variation in efficacy between different donors (10% vs 39% response rates). There is a paucity of FMT data in CD, indicating it may be less effective or more challenging in this disease subtype.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,125,948
ibd_microbiota_013,Explain the concept of indolimines as genotoxic metabolites and their potential role in IBD pathogenesis,"Indolimines are a new class of genotoxic metabolites derived from tryptophan that can induce DNA damage. The presence of a microbiota-encoded decarboxylase gene (aspartate aminotransferase) facilitates the biosynthesis of this class of metabolite. Colonization by indolimine-producing gut bacteria such as Morganella morganii increased intestinal permeability, a phenotype frequently correlated with exacerbated colon inflammation in IBD. Other bacterial species including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum also produced small molecules that induced DNA damage in cell-free assays and expression of the double-strand break marker γ-H2AX in epithelial cells. This DNA damage was caused by a mechanism independent of colibactin-mediated DNA damage driven by selected E. coli strains, indicating the presence of multiple bacteria-associated genotoxic metabolites that could potentially contribute to IBD pathogenesis through chronic epithelial damage.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,104,962
ibd_microbiota_014,Describe the neuroimmune mechanisms linking gut microbiota to pain perception and inflammation in IBD,"The gut microbiota modulates neuroimmune mechanisms affecting pain and inflammation through multiple pathways. Pain is a common symptom in IBD, and the overabundance of enteric-associated neurons (EANs) in inflamed bowel regions correlates with colitis severity. The microbiota can modulate gut-extrinsic EANs - depletion of gut microbiome resulted in increased cFos expression (a neuronal activity marker), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Specific bacterial species and their metabolites (SCFAs, bile acids, GLP-1, peptide YY) modulate sympathetic activity and activate brainstem sensory nuclei. TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, which also regulate microbiota composition. Microbial metabolites can regulate activation of brainstem sensory nuclei with polysynaptic connections to the intestine, establishing a gut-brain-gut axis. Additionally, the presence of microbial communities induces AHR expression in EANs, which activates genes regulating neuronal excitability and results in increased intestinal peristaltic activity.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,101,1193

These bile acid conjugates were enriched in patients with IBD, particularly in a dysbiotic state from patients with Crohn's disease but not UC. There was a strong positive correlation between the presence of Clostridium bolteae and conjugated bile acids, with certain C. bolteae strains able to synthesize phenylalanocholic acid. In a cell-based system, bile acid conjugates stimulated the FXR receptor and expression of its target genes. Several additional amino acid-conjugated bile acids have been discovered using reverse metabolomics approaches and are increased in patients with CD, produced by bacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera. These novel conjugates represent a distinct mechanism of bile acid modification that may contribute specifically to CD pathogenesis.",11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf,['11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,126,968

Prospective studies observed an incidence of 5 per million and prevalence of 50 per million for IBD in children from 1993 to 2002. The annual incidence of CD was 3.2 cases per million from 1983 to 1992, rising to 16.6 cases per million from 1993 to 2002. This increase parallels significant changes in industrialization and lifestyle over the last four decades, which greatly impacted dietary and sedentary behaviors. Dietary factors, medication, and smoking are postulated to contribute to the increased CD pathogenesis in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective hospital-based study of 312 Saudi IBD subjects from 1970 to 2008 showed the mean age of patients with IBD was 25.5 (SD 10.6) years.",12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf,['12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,138,846

A heatmap of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was created and annotated with categorical metadata. Evidence of structure in the data related to differences in community composition was observed, with groups of samples showing clear differences evident by relatively high Bray-Curtis dissimilarity estimates. However, no clear patterns associated with disease status (IBD diagnosis) were evident in either PCoA scatterplots or heatmaps. The study concluded that IBD status was not a main driver of microbiome dissimilarity in this population, with age (R²=0.0665, p=5e-04) and sex (R²=0.0147, p=0.0379) being the only statistically significant factors, though explaining relatively small proportions of variance.",12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf,['12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,100,1013

The majority of data processing was executed in QIIME2 with custom scripts. Paired-end reads were joined using the VSEARCH function. Chimera amplicon removal and abundance filtering were processed using Deblur. Amplicon sequences were clustered and assembled into OTUs using closed reference clustering against the Greengenes (13_8 database) using VSEARCH. Taxonomic assignment was performed using a pre-trained Naïve Bayes classifier with Greengenes OTU database.

These genes were attributed to 18 bacterial species by clustering. The best AUC achieved was 0.78 with nine species in a ROC analysis with tenfold cross validation. This accuracy, while lower than the 0.98 for LGC/HGC separation, is substantially better than an AUC of 0.58 achieved by ROC analysis of 32 human genome loci associated with adiposity measures, suggesting that the obesity-associated signal in the human gut microbiome is much stronger than that presently known in the human genome",14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf,['14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,116,740

microbiome_richness_014,What evidence suggests that low gut bacterial richness is associated with multiple chronic diseases beyond obesity?,"Low richness of gut microbiota has been reported in multiple conditions: inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), elderly patients with inflammation, and obese individuals. The study suggests that low-grade inflammation associated with a plethora of chronic diseases may share a common feature of low gut bacterial richness. The LGC phenotype includes features that bring individuals at increased risk of pre-diabetes, type-2 diabetes and ischaemic cardiovascular disorders.

The cell wall glycoconjugates of Firmicutes more readily traverse the intestinal barrier, gaining access to the host's systemic circulation and persisting within the body, thereby enhancing their ability to modulate systemic immunity. Anti-tuberculosis therapy is associated with a reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, potentially exerting consequential effects on the immune system",15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf,['15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,116,633

tb_microbiome_011,What is the gut-lung axis and how does it relate to tuberculosis pathogenesis?,"The gut-lung axis refers to the bidirectional relationship where the gut microbiota can influence respiratory diseases and vice versa. Intestinal disorders may affect the lungs through lung inflammation, as both have similar immune messengers and inflammatory processes. The relationship between gut microbiota and respiratory diseases may be related to classic immune inflammatory pathways such as the T cell family and pattern recognition receptors. TNF-α, inflammatory factors such as IL-22 and their regulatory substances constitute the common substance of the intestinal lung axis, which may be related to drug resistance. Intestinal microbiota can regulate the immune response of lung tissue through SCFAs, cytokines, and other factors, thereby affecting the development and outcome of lung diseases including tuberculosis",15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf,['15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,78,828

This is significant because bacteria within the Bacteroidota phylum are capable of utilizing dietary fibers to produce SCFAs, which are crucial for colonocyte energy, immune regulation, and inflammatory response. The sustained reduction throughout treatment suggests prolonged impairment of SCFA production capacity, potentially affecting immune function and gut homeostasis",15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf,['15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,126,680

This is clinically concerning because while Enterococcus can enhance gastrointestinal adhesion by producing extracellular polysaccharides and facilitate probiotic colonization, in tuberculosis patients undergoing long-term antibiotic therapy or with compromised immunity, Enterococcus are prone to translocation leading to enterococcal infections. Moreover, their ability to accumulate mutations and acquire exogenous genetic elements confers additional antibiotic resistance, rendering Enterococcus as one of the major nosocomial pathogens, suggesting potential drug resistance or pathogenic risk",15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf,['15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,146,865

Higher glucose availability in the intestine likely drives fermentation to lactate and growth, causing acidosis and endotoxemia",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,92,496
tb_fermentation_008,How does lactic acidosis affect the gut microbiome composition and why is this significant?,"Lactic acidosis strongly suppresses the normal gut flora from Bacteroidetes and provides a carbon source for competitors such as pathogenic Proteobacteria or lactate-utilizing Firmicutes species. Observed taxonomic changes closely mirrored experimentally established effects of lactate acidosis on human colon microbiota, showing depletion of Bacteroidetes and increase of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and pH-tolerant Firmicutes. This destabilizes resident flora and promotes pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, C. difficile, and Vibrio cholerae that are adapted to low pH and benefit from lactate consumption",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,91,668
tb_fermentation_009,Explain the relationship between increased glycolysis and bacterial growth in TB patients' gut microbiomes,Higher flux of glucose causes most bacteria to prefer glycolysis to grow and divide rapidly. Glycolysis supports 110 times faster generation of biosynthetic precursors and energy in terms of ATP but rapidly produces lactate. Higher use of glucose oxidation (glycolysis) compared to healthy controls indicates higher glucose availability in patients' intestines. Glycolysis supports a higher rate of generating ATP and biosynthetic precursors for dividing bacteria. A relatively higher presence of the pentose phosphate pathway also indicates higher glucose consumption and reactions that synthesize additional biosynthetic precursors needed for dividing cells,17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],medium,mechanism,open_ended,,,106,659
tb_fermentation_010,What bacterial families contributed most to the increased homolactic fermentation pathway in TB patients?,"Major contributors to increased homolactic fermentation included representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), Streptococcaceae (Streptococcus thermophilus, S. salivarius, S. parasanguinis, and S. gallolyticus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Clostridium innocuum). These families were also among major contributors to higher glycolysis. Homolactic acid fermentation is used by lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and many Streptococci, as well as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,105,555
tb_fermentation_011,How does lactate directly interfere with the host's immune response to tuberculosis?,"Lactate has a multifaceted effect on the immune response to MTB. On one hand, lactate improves clearance of MTB in already infected macrophages by promoting autophagy. On the other hand, it markedly suppresses both TNF-α and IFN-γ but leaves IL6 and IL10 unaffected, thereby interfering with further enhancement of anti-MTB activity. Moreover, lactate specifically upregulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that cause lung destruction in tuberculosis, a process known to result in higher morbidity and mortality in TB treatment. The balance between antibacterial activity of macrophages and tissue destruction by extracellular enzymes is critical to disease outcome and transmission",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,84,685

Closer inspection revealed that healthy donors featured a more diverse collection of Prevotella subclades and lineages than TB patients. A recent large-scale study found that Prevotella copri clade diversity was reduced in populations with Westernized diets and disease settings, while non-industrialized societies with fiber-rich traditional diets featured richer diversity. TB patients show reduced diversity of Prevotella copri clades, suggesting that Prevotella copri clade C's association with TB is likely driven by depletion of other lineages rather than a detrimental role of this particular clade",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,118,771
tb_fermentation_013,"What is the relationship between serum lactate levels and tuberculosis outcomes, and how might gut microbiota contribute?","Serum lactic acidosis is associated with higher mortality during TB treatment and other infections, and monitoring lactate acidosis was shown to help rescue TB patients. Elevated serum lactate correlates with lung pathology and higher mortality. In the context of ongoing inflammation, high lactate in patients' serum can be attributed to glycolytic activity of immune cells and inflamed tissue environment. However, the study's findings point to an additional unacknowledged source for high lactate in patients' sera: the gut microbiota. The higher presence of pathways for lactic acid fermentation and glycolysis indicates a higher propensity of the gut community to acidify the intestine, which may contribute to elevated serum lactate levels",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,121,745

Major contributors (taxa contributing more than 1% of the total) included families: Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Prevotellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, Hafniaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Vibrionaceae, belonging mainly to phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Several families that contributed to higher cell wall synthesis also contributed to higher presence of pathways for energy production through glycolysis and homolactic fermentation",17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf,['17-Excess_fermentation_and_lactic_acidosis_as_detrimental_functions_of_the_gut_microbes_in_treatment-naive_TB_patients.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,110,919

gi_microbiota_tb_011,Explain the concept of the gut-lung axis as it relates to tuberculosis treatment,"The gut-lung axis refers to bidirectional cross-talk between intestinal bacteria and the lung, where gastrointestinal colonization by specific taxa differentially modulates host biology both locally and systemically. In TB treatment, gut microbiota-educated immune cells and small molecules circulate throughout the periphery, affecting systemic immune responses. For example, modulation of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) by gut bacteria regulates immune response to Mtb in a dendritic cell-dependent manner in the lung. This means antibiotic-induced perturbations of the gut microbiome can influence pulmonary TB disease outcomes through systemic immunomodulation",18-Gastrointestinal_microbiota_composition_predicts_peripheral_inflammatory_state_during_treatment_of_human_tuberculosis.pdf,['18-Gastrointestinal_microbiota_composition_predicts_peripheral_inflammatory_state_during_treatment_of_human_tuberculosis.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,80,677

NTZ had a more substantial disruptive effect, depleting 387 ASVs and enhancing 16 ASVs. NTZ caused reduction of a larger swath of Clostridiales including all but one ASV depleted by HRZE, plus many additional Firmicutes.

By comparing three groups (HRZE with both effects, NTZ with only microbiome perturbation, and baseline), and using individual variability in responses within each arm, the researchers could train Random Forest models that explicitly accounted for both TTP changes and microbiome changes as independent predictors of inflammatory pathway expression.

The creation of IL-4 by Th2 cells primarily facilitates the differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. On the one hand, it positively regulates the anti-TB response; on the other hand, as an anti-inflammatory factor, IL-4 can induce macrophages to accelerate apoptosis when the disease is severe, leading to pathogenic damage. The study results favor the latter interpretation, with IL-4 selectively controlling antigen presentation to inhibit Th1 cell function, maintain Th2 cell proliferation, cause immune damage, and even form cavitary lesions of TB",20-Gut_microbiome__T_cell_subsets__and_cytokine_analysis_identify_differential_biomarkers_in_tuberculosis.pdf,['20-Gut_microbiome__T_cell_subsets__and_cytokine_analysis_identify_differential_biomarkers_in_tuberculosis.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,86,618

ptb_microbiome_015,Explain the proposed mechanism by which gut microbiota dysbiosis affects PTB pathology through the gut-lung axis and nutrient metabolism,"The study hypothesizes that changes in gut microbiota exert an impact on PTB clinical characteristics through the gut-lung axis by regulating the nutrient utilization pathway. PTB patients showed enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and reduction of SCFA-producing probiotics, causing imbalance in intestinal flora structure and function. This dysbiosis led to pathological metabolism in the PTB group, with significantly increased metabolism/degradation pathways of amino acids and glycan indicating an increased basal metabolic rate consistent with low fever pathology of PTB. The upregulation of these pathways resulted from complicated microbial interaction networks demanding more nutrients. Additionally, increased LPS production from anaerobic bacteria facilitated by compromised intestinal barrier integrity further aggravated host inflammation, connecting microbiota changes to the clinical manifestations of malnutrition, altered lipid metabolism, and hyperglycemia in PTB patients",23-The_correlation_between_dysfunctional_intestinal_flora_and_pathology_feature_of_patients_with_pulmonary_tuberculosis.pdf,['23-The_correlation_between_dysfunctional_intestinal_flora_and_pathology_feature_of_patients_with_pulmonary_tuberculosis.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,136,994

While it's likely these changes were caused by M. tuberculosis infection based on similar results in murine models, the possibility that dysbiosis precedes and contributes to infection cannot be excluded. Additionally, as only TB patients and healthy controls were included, it's unclear if the gut bacteria and suggested model can discriminate TB patients from other non-TB patients. To be a potential diagnostic method, the accuracy and specificity should be validated in large-scale sampling studies.

microbiome_health_013,"Describe the complex cascade of events that leads from respiratory dysbiosis to respiratory exacerbations, including the role of environmental changes, inflammatory responses, and bacterial growth","Respiratory exacerbations are acute events of respiratory dysbiosis accompanied by a dysregulated host immune response. In some disease states, increased airway wall permeability and mucus production introduce nutrient supply to the normally sparse lung environment. The mucus introduces pockets of increased temperature and decreased oxygen tension, selectively favoring the growth of disease-associated microbes. Enhanced immunogenicity exposes airways and alveoli to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and microbial metabolites that provoke further inflammation, which in turn further alters airway conditions. The generation of intraalveolar catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines promotes the growth of select bacterial species such as P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia complex, whereas the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells kills and clears bacteria with variable, species-specific effectiveness.

The beneficial interplay of the host and its microbiome is responsible for maintaining the host's health, whereas disease development is often correlated with microbial dysbiosis or a shift in the microbiota. Pathogens represent only a tiny fraction of microorganisms, whereby the altered composition of the microbiome promotes the emergence and outbreak of pathogens. The vast majority of microbes are crucial for ecosystem functioning as well as beneficial interactions with other microbes, contributing to population dynamics and functional activities. Thus, opportunistic pathogens show that host-microbe interactions depend not only on the host but also on the entire microbiome.

microbiome_health_015,"Analyze the multi-factorial relationship between age, microbiome composition, and disease susceptibility across the human lifespan from infancy to old age","The microbiome changes significantly across the lifespan. In infancy, facultative anaerobes first colonize the gut at birth, creating anaerobic conditions that promote obligate anaerobes like Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides within 2 weeks. Mode of delivery and feeding method (breastfeeding vs formula) significantly affect initial colonization. By age 3, the microbiome resembles that of adults. In prepubescent children, increased hormones during puberty stimulate sebaceous glands, favoring growth of lipophilic microorganisms like Propionibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., and fungal Malassezia spp. This relates to disease susceptibility, with atopic dermatitis related to Staphylococcus more common in prepubescent children, while Malassezia-related tinea versicolor is more prominent in adults. In old age (>65 years), there is a decline in microbiota diversity with reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of Bacteroidetes increases while Firmicutes becomes less abundant. Decreased immune activity makes elderly adults more susceptible to pathogens.

antibiotic_microbiome_010,What is the difference in how antibiotics affect chromosomally-encoded versus MGE-encoded ARGs over time?,"In the short term, the increase in resistome burden after antibiotic treatment is primarily driven by the enrichment of chromosomally encoded ARGs (that is, the expansion of resistant bacterial lineages). However, the abundance of microorganisms with chromosomal ARGs declines sharply shortly thereafter (approximately 1 month). Conversely, MGE-encoded ARGs persist for longer periods after therapy cessation, probably due to the parasitic nature of MGEs (their persistence among bacterial populations despite the absence of antibiotic-mediated growth advantages or presence of fitness defects conferred on the bacterial host)",8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf,['8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf'],medium,comparison,open_ended,,,105,626

DAV132 can adsorb antibiotics belonging to six drug classes ex vivo. Coadministration of DAV132 with antibiotics protects gut bacterial richness and diversity, impedes the spread of pathobionts and resistant organisms, and maintains the colonization resistance capacity of the gut against C. difficile. DAV132 can be further modified to achieve site-specific inactivation: coating of the adsorbent in a pH-dependent polymer ensures its release and activity in the colon, without compromising the antibiotic activity in the small intestine",8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf,['8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,82,719

Notably, TEM1 was designed to be expressed by two gene segments as two enzymatically inactive components that reconstitute the functional enzyme on secretion: this split nature of the gene minimizes the risk of its spread through HGT. Similarly, probiotic E. coli was engineered to sense extracellular sialic acid (a proxy for gut dysbiosis) and respond by producing a bile salt hydrolase, deconjugating primary bile salts in the gut, which reduced germination of C. difficile endospores",8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf,['8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,118,869
antibiotic_microbiome_014,What are the key limitations of short-read metagenomic sequencing for studying HGT and the resistome?,"Short-read metagenome assemblies are highly fragmented and cannot be used for identification of genetic origins (chromosome versus plasmid) and taxonomic origins of ARGs. The relatively short length of assembled contigs makes it impractical to determine the genomic origins of these contigs. Many assembled contigs, particularly those corresponding to mobile genetic elements, remain unbinned, obscuring their taxonomic origins. Additionally, because of the total DNA extraction step that typically precedes sequencing library preparation, shotgun metagenomic sequencing does not enable efficient linking of MGEs with bacterial hosts, obscuring community HGT dynamics. These limitations can be addressed through long-read sequencing and Hi-C platforms, which preserve information regarding MGE-bacterial host associations",8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf,['8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,101,821

ibd_metabolomics_012,"Compare the metagenomic signatures of CD between pediatric and adult patients, and explain what this reveals about disease pathogenesis","Pediatric CD patients showed significant increases in Ralstonia insidiosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, while showing decreases in Blautia spp. and Coprococcus comes. However, the expected increase in Escherichia coli was not observed in adult CD patients, despite being elevated in pediatric CD (log2FoldChange = 3.45, FDR = 0.007). Pediatric patients had a more consolidated metabolome spectrum than adults, with more homogeneous metabolomic profiles, suggesting a special mechanism of CD development in childhood. The metabolome differences between adults and children may reflect that pediatric CD represents primary alterations, while adult CD may be caused by both endogenous and exogenous factors that dramatically change microbiota. This distinction suggests CD in children has more limited spectrum of metabolic and metagenomic changes, which may enhance prospects for identifying specific pathognomonic factors",9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf,['9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf'],hard,comparison,open_ended,,,135,957
ibd_metabolomics_013,"Explain the diagnostic algorithm developed for pediatric IBD risk assessment, including the mathematical basis and clinical interpretation thresholds","The risk coefficient formula includes metabolites that are significantly different between IBD and control groups. For statistically significant metabolites, biserial correlation was calculated with FDR correction; metabolites with absolute correlation coefficient |r| > 0.3 were included. Positively correlated metabolites were placed in the numerator, negatively correlated ones in the denominator: Kr = log₁₀(1/(pentanoic acid + Phenol,4-methyl + Indole)). ROC analysis determined risk thresholds: values below the 5th percentile indicated no risk (Kr < 4.01), values between 4.01 and 4.79 suggest low risk requiring additional clinical markers, and values above 4.79 (above 25th percentile) indicate high risk requiring further examination and can detect asymptomatic cases. For differential diagnosis, high-risk CD cases show reduced 1H-indole-3-methyl, while UC cases show altered pentanoic acid, phenol 4-methyl, and acetate levels",9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf,['9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,149,938
ibd_metabolomics_014,"Analyze the paradoxical finding that pediatric IBD patients showed greater metabolite diversity than controls, contrary to expectations. What mechanisms might explain this?","Contrary to initial expectations, comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed that the control group had fewer diversely represented volatile metabolites than the IBD group in pediatric patients (opposite to adult patterns). This paradoxical finding may be explained by several factors: (1) therapy being taken by patients may introduce additional metabolites, (2) excessive bacterial growth in IBD provokes secretion of numerous volatile components, (3) treatment-derived xenobiotic metabolites significantly contribute to observed metabolic signatures. While patients with IBD typically have reduced microbiota diversity (which should result in fewer identified metabolites), the overall spectrum of detectable metabolites is actually larger due to these additional factors. In contrast, adults with chronic IBD demonstrate a more stable metabolomic profile reflecting long-term adaptation to disease. This suggests the wide variety of components in pediatric IBD patients reflects acute dysbiosis and therapeutic intervention rather than adaptive microbiome changes",9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf,['9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf'],hard,mechanism,open_ended,,,172,1069
