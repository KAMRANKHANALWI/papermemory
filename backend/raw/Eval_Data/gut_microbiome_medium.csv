ibd_microbiota_007,Describe the mechanism by which 3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA) and isoalloLCA modulate intestinal inflammation,"3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA), derived from lithocholic acid, inhibits intestinal TH17 cell differentiation via binding to RORγ. IsoalloLCA enhances Treg cell differentiation by binding to nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) and increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. Treg cells induced by isoalloLCA suppress inflammation in colitis models. In individuals with Crohn's disease, levels of 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA were decreased, and upregulated genes associated with TH17 cells and IL-17 in IBD patients were found to have negative correlation with these secondary bile acids.",[],,medium,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_008,How does adherent-invasive Escherichia coli contribute to intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease?,"Adherent-invasive E. coli, which is enriched in individuals with Crohn's disease, promotes intestinal inflammation through propanediol dehydratase-dependent production of propionate and modulation of IL-1β-producing CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes. During IBD, the loss of intestinal hypoxia allows E. coli, a facultative anaerobe, to use reactive oxygen and nitrogen by-products for anaerobic respiration to grow and outcompete gut commensals.",[],,medium,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_009,What role does the CARD9 gene variant play in fungal immunity and IBD susceptibility?,CARD9 is a critical mediator of systemic antifungal IgG antibody responses to C. albicans and plays a role in CARD9-dependent tuning of the human antibody repertoire. A certain risk variant (S12N; rs4077515) of CARD9 fosters greater TNF and IL-6 production by dendritic cells upon stimulation with depleted zymosan or whole yeast cells. The protective variant (S12NΔ11; rs141992399) leads to attenuated pro-inflammatory signalling through impaired interaction with the ubiquitin ligase TRIM62 upon stimulation with fungal cell wall ligands.

ibd_microbiota_010,Explain the dual role of microbiota-reactive B cells in IBD pathogenesis,"Microbiota-reactive B cells play a dual role in IBD. On the pathogenic side, perturbations of the B cell compartment with expansion of bacteria-reactive IgG+ plasma cells have been described in IBD, and B cell-associated pathology in CD involves cytotoxic T cells with specificity to gut fungal antigens, which are enriched in individuals with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. On the protective side, B cells produce secretory IgA, the most abundant immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents direct contact between luminal factors (including bacteria) and intestinal epithelial cells. Secretory IgA can also target fungi with high affinity for fungal hyphae, and gut fungi such as C. albicans induce IgA class switch recombination or activate antibody production systemically.",[],,medium,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_011,Describe how autophagy proteins and ATG16L1 variants affect Paneth cell function and intestinal inflammation,"Defects in autophagy and loss-of-function mutations in autophagy genes are well-documented drivers of IBD. Polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes such as ATG16L1 are strongly associated with both UC and CD. Autophagy proteins prevent intestinal inflammation by supporting Paneth cell homeostasis and viability, controlling endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, and secreting antimicrobial proteins to reinforce intestinal epithelial barrier function. Individuals with variants in ATG16L1 and NOD2 show defective Treg cell responses to outer membrane vesicles delivered by Bacteroides fragilis. Mice with Atg16l1 variants associated with increased CD risk exhibit structural abnormalities in Paneth cells following murine norovirus infection. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 produced by γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes protects Paneth cells from death during intestinal inflammation in both mice and humans carrying the ATG16L1 IBD risk allele.",[],,medium,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf

Options: A) Streptococcus salivarius B) Streptococcus mutans C) Lactobacillus rhamnosus D) Bifidobacterium longum,"B. The bacteria involved in dental caries are Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Dental caries manifest when acid-producing bacteria residing in the oral cavity interact with fermentable carbohydrate found in food.

fiber_microbiota_008,What happens to the gut microbiota when the diet is devoid of dietary fibers?,"When the diet is devoid of dietary fibers, prolonged lack damages the mucus barrier and is associated with increased abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila.

fiber_microbiota_011,What are the detrimental metabolites produced from protein fermentation when dietary fiber intake is low?,"When dietary fiber intake is low, gut microbial metabolism shifts toward utilization of dietary and endogenous proteins, leading to production of branched-chain fatty acids, ammonia, amines, N-nitroso compounds, phenolic compounds including p-Cresol, sulphides, indolic compounds, and hydrogen sulfide. These metabolites are cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory, contributing to the development of chronic diseases, particularly colorectal cancer",[],,medium,mechanism,open_ended,7-The_Impact_of_Dietary_Fiber_on_Gut_Microbiota_in_Host_Health_and_Disease.pdf

antibiotic_microbiome_008,Describe the mechanism by which butyrate consumption creates an anaerobic environment in the gut,"Beta-oxidation of butyrate by colonocytes consumes oxygen, resulting in an anaerobic milieu in the gut. Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced when butyrate levels are low.

antibiotic_microbiome_009,How does a Western-style diet combined with antibiotics affect the gut and what are the consequences?,"Investigations into Western-style diets (high in fat and simple sugars) have shown that antibiotic treatment of mice on a high-fat diet provokes pathological inflammation at the gut mucosa and increased levels of Enterobacterales. These mice displayed immunological symptoms of pre-inflammatory bowel disease, probably due to the combined metabolic influence of the high-fat diet on gut epithelial cells and changes in microbiome structure.

antibiotic_microbiome_010,What is the difference in how antibiotics affect chromosomally-encoded versus MGE-encoded ARGs over time?,"In the short term, the increase in resistome burden after antibiotic treatment is primarily driven by the enrichment of chromosomally encoded ARGs (that is, the expansion of resistant bacterial lineages). However, the abundance of microorganisms with chromosomal ARGs declines sharply shortly thereafter (approximately 1 month). Conversely, MGE-encoded ARGs persist for longer periods after therapy cessation, probably due to the parasitic nature of MGEs (their persistence among bacterial populations despite the absence of antibiotic-mediated growth advantages or presence of fitness defects conferred on the bacterial host)",[],,medium,comparison,open_ended,8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf
