Propionic and butyric acids contribute to colonic and peripheral Treg cell differentiation through activation of the GPR43 fatty acid receptor.

On the pathogenic side, perturbations of the B cell compartment with expansion of bacteria-reactive IgG+ plasma cells have been described in IBD, and B cell-associated pathology in CD involves cytotoxic T cells with specificity to gut fungal antigens, which are enriched in individuals with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. On the protective side, B cells produce secretory IgA, the most abundant immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents direct contact between luminal factors (including bacteria) and intestinal epithelial cells. Secretory IgA can also target fungi with high affinity for fungal hyphae, and gut fungi such as C. albicans induce IgA class switch recombination or activate antibody production systemically.",

Polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes such as ATG16L1 are strongly associated with both UC and CD. Autophagy proteins prevent intestinal inflammation by supporting Paneth cell homeostasis and viability, controlling endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, and secreting antimicrobial proteins to reinforce intestinal epithelial barrier function. Individuals with variants in ATG16L1 and NOD2 show defective Treg cell responses to outer membrane vesicles delivered by Bacteroides fragilis. Mice with Atg16l1 variants associated with increased CD risk exhibit structural abnormalities in Paneth cells following murine norovirus infection. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 produced by γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes protects Paneth cells from death during intestinal inflammation in both mice and humans carrying the ATG16L1 IBD risk allele.",

In UC, randomized controlled trials demonstrated remission rates of 24–53%, with four out of five trials showing statistically significant benefit. Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium hallii enrichment, along with increased faecal SCFAs, was associated with remission, whereas increases in Escherichia spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Candida spp. were associated with lack of response. Increased Candida spp. abundance pre-FMT was associated with clinical response, while decreased Candida spp. abundance post-FMT indicated ameliorated disease severity. Both donor material and recipient-specific factors including engraftment play a part in response, with variation in efficacy between different donors (10% vs 39% response rates). There is a paucity of FMT data in CD, indicating it may be less effective or more challenging in this disease subtype.",

The presence of a microbiota-encoded decarboxylase gene (aspartate aminotransferase) facilitates the biosynthesis of this class of metabolite. Colonization by indolimine-producing gut bacteria such as Morganella morganii increased intestinal permeability, a phenotype frequently correlated with exacerbated colon inflammation in IBD. Other bacterial species including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum also produced small molecules that induced DNA damage in cell-free assays and expression of the double-strand break marker γ-H2AX in epithelial cells. This DNA damage was caused by a mechanism independent of colibactin-mediated DNA damage driven by selected E. coli strains, indicating the presence of multiple bacteria-associated genotoxic metabolites that could potentially contribute to IBD pathogenesis through chronic epithelial damage.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "The gut microbiota modulates neuroimmune mechanisms affecting pain and inflammation through multiple pathways. Pain is a common symptom in IBD, and the overabundance of enteric-associated neurons (EANs) in inflamed bowel regions correlates with colitis severity. The microbiota can modulate gut-extrinsic EANs - depletion of gut microbiome resulted in increased cFos expression (a neuronal activity marker), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Specific bacterial species and their metabolites (SCFAs, bile acids, GLP-1, peptide YY) modulate sympathetic activity and activate brainstem sensory nuclei. TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, which also regulate microbiota composition. Microbial metabolites can regulate activation of brainstem sensory nuclei with polysynaptic connections to the intestine, establishing a gut-brain-gut axis. Additionally, the presence of microbial communities induces AHR expression in EANs, which activates genes regulating neuronal excitability and results in increased intestinal peristaltic activity.",

These bile acid conjugates were enriched in patients with IBD, particularly in a dysbiotic state from patients with Crohn's disease but not UC. There was a strong positive correlation between the presence of Clostridium bolteae and conjugated bile acids, with certain C. bolteae strains able to synthesize phenylalanocholic acid. In a cell-based system, bile acid conjugates stimulated the FXR receptor and expression of its target genes. Several additional amino acid-conjugated bile acids have been discovered using reverse metabolomics approaches and are increased in patients with CD, produced by bacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera. These novel conjugates represent a distinct mechanism of bile acid modification that may contribute specifically to CD pathogenesis.",
