Indeed, they observed several microbial genera that were not well characterized in prior IBD studies, including Lachnoclostridium (upregulated in CD), Harryflintia (associated with high-fat diet in mice but less known in CD), and specific patterns of Akkermansia abundance. Only a subset of OTUs were overlapping with UC versus CD characterizations by Jansson and colleagues, suggesting that classification algorithms trained largely on IBD subjects of European ancestry may not perform well when applied to participants from the Middle East. This highlights the importance of population-specific microbiome studies.",

Prospective studies observed an incidence of 5 per million and prevalence of 50 per million for IBD in children from 1993 to 2002. The annual incidence of CD was 3.2 cases per million from 1983 to 1992, rising to 16.6 cases per million from 1993 to 2002. This increase parallels significant changes in industrialization and lifestyle over the last four decades, which greatly impacted dietary and sedentary behaviors. Dietary factors, medication, and smoking are postulated to contribute to the increased CD pathogenesis in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective hospital-based study of 312 Saudi IBD subjects from 1970 to 2008 showed the mean age of patients with IBD was 25.5 (SD 10.6) years.",

The majority of data processing was executed in QIIME2 with custom scripts. Paired-end reads were joined using the VSEARCH function. Chimera amplicon removal and abundance filtering were processed using Deblur. Amplicon sequences were clustered and assembled into OTUs using closed reference clustering against the Greengenes (13_8 database) using VSEARCH. Taxonomic assignment was performed using a pre-trained Naïve Bayes classifier with Greengenes OTU database. The abundance tables from QIIME2 were combined into a Phyloseq object (version 4.1.1), normalized for library size variation using DADA2, and further analyzed in R with custom scripts.
