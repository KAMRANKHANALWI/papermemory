Primary bile acids (cholate and chenodeoxycholate) are deconjugated by gram-positive bacterial species such as Lactobacilli. After deconjugation, additional microbial modifications by Clostridium species give rise to secondary bile acids, which influence energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis via their effects on gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.
