Intestinal disorders may affect the lungs through lung inflammation, as both have similar immune messengers and inflammatory processes. The relationship between gut microbiota and respiratory diseases may be related to classic immune inflammatory pathways such as the T cell family and pattern recognition receptors. TNF-α, inflammatory factors such as IL-22 and their regulatory substances constitute the common substance of the intestinal lung axis, which may be related to drug resistance. Intestinal microbiota can regulate the immune response of lung tissue through SCFAs, cytokines, and other factors, thereby affecting the development and outcome of lung diseases including tuberculosis",

Specifically, it decreased from 11.95% at baseline to 7.69% at 2 months (P=0.04), and further decreased from baseline 11.95% to 6.64% at 6 months (P=0.006). This is significant because bacteria within the Bacteroidota phylum are capable of utilizing dietary fibers to produce SCFAs, which are crucial for colonocyte energy, immune regulation, and inflammatory response.

Escherichia-Shigella has been found to dominate gut microbiome dysbiosis in tuberculous meningitis patients and could serve as a strong indicator for forecasting microbiota dysbiosis triggered by anti-tuberculosis treatment.

This is clinically concerning because while Enterococcus can enhance gastrointestinal adhesion by producing extracellular polysaccharides and facilitate probiotic colonization, in tuberculosis patients undergoing long-term antibiotic therapy or with compromised immunity, Enterococcus are prone to translocation leading to enterococcal infections. Moreover, their ability to accumulate mutations and acquire exogenous genetic elements confers additional antibiotic resistance, rendering Enterococcus as one of the major nosocomial pathogens, suggesting potential drug resistance or pathogenic risk",
