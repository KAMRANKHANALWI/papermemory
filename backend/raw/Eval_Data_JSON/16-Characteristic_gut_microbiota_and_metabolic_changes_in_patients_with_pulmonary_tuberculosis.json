Altered metabolites are involved in multiple pathways including ABC transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling, sulfur metabolism, galactose metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism.

Thirteen upregulated metabolites in PTB patients (including taurine, aconitic acid, and tromethamine) were negatively correlated with beneficial bacteria like Blautia, Roseburia, and Butyricicoccus. Cholesterol levels (Tch, LDL, VLDL) were positively associated with Romboutsia and Fusicatenibacter and negatively with Cetobacterium and Weissella.
