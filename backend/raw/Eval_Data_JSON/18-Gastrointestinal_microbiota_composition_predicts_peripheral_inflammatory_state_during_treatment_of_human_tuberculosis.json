In TB treatment, gut microbiota-educated immune cells and small molecules circulate throughout the periphery, affecting systemic immune responses. For example, modulation of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) by gut bacteria regulates immune response to Mtb in a dendritic cell-dependent manner in the lung.

NTZ caused reduction of a larger swath of Clostridiales including all but one ASV depleted by HRZE, plus many additional Firmicutes.

This created a natural experimental control allowing dissociation of immunologic effects of pathogen killing from microbiota perturbation. By comparing three groups (HRZE with both effects, NTZ with only microbiome perturbation, and baseline), and using individual variability in responses within each arm, the researchers could train Random Forest models that explicitly accounted for both TTP changes and microbiome changes as independent predictors of inflammatory pathway expression.

These findings suggest that microbiome-related changes in peripheral inflammatory state are induced by both treatments, and despite HRZE's more limited microbiome effect compared to NTZ, it still affected a substantial number of IBD-associated inflammatory genes, indicating microbiome perturbations during TB therapy may have systemic inflammatory consequences",
