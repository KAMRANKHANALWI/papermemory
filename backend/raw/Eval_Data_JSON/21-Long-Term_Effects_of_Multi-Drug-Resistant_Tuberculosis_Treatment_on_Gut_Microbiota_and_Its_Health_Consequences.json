(3) Trimethylamine production - bacteria like Prevotellaceae produce TMA from dietary choline/L-carnitine, which is metabolized to TMAO that inhibits reverse cholesterol transport and increases LDLC. The study found positive correlation between Prevotellaceae and LDLC",

For high antibiotic exposure (6-month TB treatment with combination therapy), altered microbiota community was observed 1.2 years after cessation, though richness recovered. However, MDR-TB treatment (20+ months with multiple antibiotics) resulted in irreversible changes: 16% decreased richness and dramatically altered composition persisting 3-8 years after treatment cessation.

      "ground_truth_answer": "According to resilience theory, gut microbiota as an ecosystem can return to its original equilibrium or achieve a new equilibrium after disturbance cessation, depending on the strength of the disturbance and the stability of the microbiota. The MDR-TB treatment represents an unprecedented disturbance - none of the previously studied antibiotic treatments has comparable impact. The new equilibrium is driven by both direct effects (elimination of certain bacterial species by antibiotics) and indirect effects (loss of autotrophic bacteria that rely on fermentation products of eliminated bacteria, or competitive bacteria that previously competed with eliminated bacteria). The network analysis also suggested close correlations among bacterial genera, meaning elimination of some species affects others",
