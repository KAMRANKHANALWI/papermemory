PTB patients showed enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and reduction of SCFA-producing probiotics, causing imbalance in intestinal flora structure and function. This dysbiosis led to pathological metabolism in the PTB group, with significantly increased metabolism/degradation pathways of amino acids and glycan indicating an increased basal metabolic rate consistent with low fever pathology of PTB. The upregulation of these pathways resulted from complicated microbial interaction networks demanding more nutrients. Additionally, increased LPS production from anaerobic bacteria facilitated by compromised intestinal barrier integrity further aggravated host inflammation, connecting microbiota changes to the clinical manifestations of malnutrition, altered lipid metabolism, and hyperglycemia in PTB patients",
