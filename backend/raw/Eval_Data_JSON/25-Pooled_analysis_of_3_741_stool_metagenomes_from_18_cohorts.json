The species carried differentially abundant genes in CRC (Anpan taxon-wise q < 0.1, absolute estimate > 1), particularly genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism that showed higher carriage in later CRC stages. This is significant because carbohydrate metabolism is altered in CRC, and the findings suggest Firmicutes-specific metabolism could promote tumor differentiation.

Significantly, 21 of 125 SGBs (16.8%) positively associated with CRC were oral-typical, compared to 34 of 488 (7.0%) non-significant SGBs (Fisher's test P < 0.01).
