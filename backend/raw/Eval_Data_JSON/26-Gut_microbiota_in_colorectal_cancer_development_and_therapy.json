Non-bacterial components show: (1) Viruses: enteric viromes altered with enrichment of Orthobunyavirus, Inovirus and Tunalikevirus genera, with trans-kingdom interactions between viral and bacterial communities. (2) Fungi: distinct mycobiome profiles with elevated Basidiomycota:Ascomycota ratio and enrichment of Aspergillus species, showing co-occurrence with pathogenic bacteria.

It also drives NF-κB signalling and BIRC3 expression, inhibiting apoptosis. However, for immune checkpoint therapy, F. nucleatum paradoxically enhances anti-PD-L1 antibody efficacy. While colonization activates STING–NF-κB signalling and PD-L1 expression in CRC cells, it also promotes CD8+ T cell activation when PD-L1 is inhibited. Patients with tumours harbouring F. nucleatum or high faecal levels show improved responses and progression-free survival on anti-PD-1 antibodies",

Depletion of gut microbiota using antibiotics supports the tumour-suppressive potential of mutant p53 in the distal colon in conditional Trp53R270H-knockin mice, attenuating colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, gut microbiota-derived gallic acid abolishes the tumour-suppressing function of mutant p53 and promotes CRC development in Trp53R270H mice via hyperactivation of WNT signalling.

This enzyme catalyses the formation of galactose both in vitro and in vivo, which impairs glucose utilization and activates oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a 'reverse Warburg' effect.
