Next-generation probiotics are newly identified indigenous human GM members associated with health (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila, specific Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains). However, despite associations with healthy metabolic phenotypes, an RCT with A. muciniphila did not identify strong metabolic effects, possibly due to reduced viability upon passage through the stomach, inadequate dosages, or lack of engraftment.

For GM research, the GM feature must be affected by human genetic variants strongly enough to use as instruments. Sanna et al identified human genetic variants associated with faecal SCFA levels and reported evidence for a potential causal connection between the GM's butyrate production potential and improved insulin response, and between abnormal faecal propionate levels and increased type 2 diabetes risk. Limitations include pleiotropy, problems with weak instrumental variables, and the challenge that host genetic variants must adequately mimic specific GM features. Large, high-quality studies are needed considering both MR limitations and GM research challenges (methodological differences, interindividual heterogeneity, intraindividual variability).",

Recent work shows specific small intestine microbiota members can inhibit lipid secretion and affect nutrient-induced gut-brain signaling regulating glucose homeostasis. However, it's understudied due to limitations in acquiring samples and reduced microbial abundance. Novel technologies include ingestible capsules triggered by different pH levels along the GI tract to sample throughout, though challenges remain (microbes may continue growing post-collection, giving inaccurate representation; currently developed for fasting state, limiting postprandial response studies which are important for understanding microbial contributions to glucose metabolism regulation).",
