The main limitation was the unbalanced dataset (76 T1DM vs 366 T2DM samples), which contributed to bias toward negative classification.

The paper notes that Roseburia has been negatively correlated with obesity and T2DM, and due to its role in modulating glucose homeostasis, its dysbiosis has been proposed to play a role in progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes. Zhang et al. found that Lachnospira, along with SCFA-producing bacteria like Roseburia and Clostridium, are significantly reduced in T2DM subjects.
