Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced when butyrate levels are low, creating a feedforward loop that increases luminal oxygen levels. This allows Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica to bloom",

Some gut bacteria switch their metabolism to use mucin glycans by inducing gene expression of mucin-degrading enzymes. This leads to increased penetrability of the inner mucus layer and may increase susceptibility to infections",

Binding of both bile acids and specific bacteria to the same fiber creates a platform that allows low abundant bacteria like Clostridium scindens to efficiently transform biomolecules and increase production of secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acids have been positively associated with both colorectal cancer and improved metabolism",

Children from urban areas of Burkina Faso had bacterial communities more similar to Italian children, with bacteria more suited to metabolize animal protein, fat, and sugar-rich foods. Rural Burkina Faso children had enrichment in Prevotella, Treponema, and Succinivibrio adapted for fiber and carbohydrate fermentation.

A low-MAC diet led to dramatically reduced microbial diversity in just three generations, which could not be restored when mice were moved back to a normal-MAC diet. This suggests that long-term reduction in fiber intake, like in the Western world, may lead to permanent extinction of important microbial taxa, potentially explaining reduced diversity in industrialized populations",

Individuals who exhibited improved metabolic profile after 3 days of BKB consumption had a higher Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio with an enrichment of Prevotella copri, reflecting the ability to degrade complex carbohydrates. This demonstrates that the capacity for using fibers varies between Prevotella- versus Bacteroides-dominated gut microbiota, with Prevotella-dominated bacteria producing higher levels and different proportions of SCFAs",
