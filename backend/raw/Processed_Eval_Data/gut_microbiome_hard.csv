gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf
gut_intro_007,How does dietary fiber deficiency affect the gut microbiota and mucosal barrier?,"Dietary fiber deficiency causes the gut microbiota to switch to utilizing secreted mucins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, thinner mucus in the distal colon, increased microbial proximity to the epithelium, and enhanced pathogen susceptibility",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf
gut_intro_009,Compare the microbiota composition between the small intestine and the colon,"The small intestine has high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials with short transit time, limiting bacterial growth to rapidly growing facultative anaerobes dominated by Lactobacillaceae. The colon supports a dense diverse community mainly of anaerobes dominated by Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae that can utilize complex carbohydrates",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf
gut_intro_011,How do antibiotics affect the gut microbiota in terms of pathogen colonization?,"Antibiotics dramatically disrupt microbial balance and alter the nutritional landscape of the gut, leading to increased mucosal carbohydrate availability including fucose and sialic acid liberated by the microbiota. This favors expansion of pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf
gut_intro_013,Explain the concept of microbial cross-feeding in the gut,"Microbial cross-feeding occurs when fermentation products from one bacterium serve as substrates for others. For example, acetate produced by Ruminococcus bromii or lactate from lactic acid bacteria is converted to butyrate by Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae. This cooperation allows colonization by more diverse organisms and shapes the microbiota community",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf
gut_intro_015,How does FUT2 genotype affect gut microbiota composition?,"FUT2 genotype determines the presence (secretor) or absence (non-secretor) of H and ABO antigens in GI mucosa through expression of an α1,2-fucosyltransferase. This affects mucin O-glycosylation patterns and influences the abundance of many bacterial groups in the gut microbiota",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf

multiomics_ibd_012,Compare the diagnostic performance of bacterial species models versus KO gene models for IBD detection,"Through CCIA with FDR < 0.0001, 74 microbial species were identified, from which 31 feature species were selected using IFE for Random Forest modeling. These species-level models showed strong ability to detect IBD with AUROC ranging from 0.66 to 0.95 across cohorts. For KO genes, 162 differentially expressed genes were identified (FDR < 1×10⁻¹²), with 25 selected as features. All cohorts except HeQ 2017 (AUROC: 0.98) showed decreased AUROC values compared to bacterial species models. Cohort-to-cohort transfer analysis for KO genes showed mean AUROC values ranging from 0.74 to 0.81. While KO gene models showed somewhat lower diagnostic performance than bacterial species models, their diagnostic sensitivity was still acceptable",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf
multiomics_ibd_013,Explain how the K22477 gene deficiency contributes to IBD symptoms through glutamate metabolism,"K22477 (argO, N-acetylglutamate synthase) is responsible for producing N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-CoA. The study revealed that IBD patients have reduced levels of K22477, leading to an excess of L-glutamate. This overabundance of L-glutamate can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in IBD patients. This finding highlights how impaired gut microbial biotransformation, resulting from substantial reduction in the gut commensal community, contributes to disease pathology",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf
multiomics_ibd_014,Describe the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets,"The study identified four genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis enzymes within the symbiotic bacterial community: K09759 (aspS, nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), K01870 (ileS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase), K01892 (hisS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase), and K01873 (valS, valyl-tRNA synthetase). This was consistent with KEGG Orthology Enrichment Analysis showing significant increase in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are indispensable for protein synthesis, recent studies indicate their biological functions extend beyond translation. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila secretes seryl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS), which modulates immune homeostasis and facilitates production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. These findings suggest ARSs from gut microbiota may influence host immune response and regulate gut homeostasis, representing a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf
multiomics_ibd_015,How does integration of multi-omics data improve IBD diagnostic performance compared to single-omics approaches?,"The study systematically evaluated combining different omics panels (31 species, 25 KO genes, 13 metabolites). When species and KO genes were combined, diagnostic performance showed AUROC > 0.97 in Renji cohort and > 0.9 in USA-NL cohort. Combining species and metabolites showed the best performance among paired combinations, generally achieving AUROC > 0.9. The integration of all three panels (species, KO genes, and metabolites) significantly enhanced diagnostic performance: In Renji cohort, 10-fold cross-validation achieved AUROC of 0.98 with independent validation reaching 0.96; in USA-NL cohorts, 10-fold cross-validation reached 0.93 with independent validation at 0.92. This represents a significant improvement over previous non-invasive diagnostic models and demonstrates that combining diverse omics data substantially enhances machine learning model performance for IBD diagnosis",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf

Options: A) Two-component system B) Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis C) Propanoate metabolism D) Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis,"C. Propanoate metabolism was observed to be downregulated in IBD. It has been reported that Akkermansia-related propanoate metabolism enhanced the development of the intestinal epithelium through intestinal stem cell-mediated mechanisms, where intestinal stem cells play a vital role in developmental processes and swift regeneration of the intestinal lining",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,10-Microbiome_and_metabolome_features_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease_via_multi-omics_integration_analyses_across_cohorts.pdf
ibd_microbiota_012,Compare the efficacy and mechanisms of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,"FMT has shown modest effects in ulcerative colitis but limited data exists for Crohn's disease. In UC, randomized controlled trials demonstrated remission rates of 24–53%, with four out of five trials showing statistically significant benefit. Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium hallii enrichment, along with increased faecal SCFAs, was associated with remission, whereas increases in Escherichia spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Candida spp. were associated with lack of response. Increased Candida spp. abundance pre-FMT was associated with clinical response, while decreased Candida spp. abundance post-FMT indicated ameliorated disease severity. Both donor material and recipient-specific factors including engraftment play a part in response, with variation in efficacy between different donors (10% vs 39% response rates). There is a paucity of FMT data in CD, indicating it may be less effective or more challenging in this disease subtype.",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_013,Explain the concept of indolimines as genotoxic metabolites and their potential role in IBD pathogenesis,"Indolimines are a new class of genotoxic metabolites derived from tryptophan that can induce DNA damage. The presence of a microbiota-encoded decarboxylase gene (aspartate aminotransferase) facilitates the biosynthesis of this class of metabolite. Colonization by indolimine-producing gut bacteria such as Morganella morganii increased intestinal permeability, a phenotype frequently correlated with exacerbated colon inflammation in IBD. Other bacterial species including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum also produced small molecules that induced DNA damage in cell-free assays and expression of the double-strand break marker γ-H2AX in epithelial cells. This DNA damage was caused by a mechanism independent of colibactin-mediated DNA damage driven by selected E. coli strains, indicating the presence of multiple bacteria-associated genotoxic metabolites that could potentially contribute to IBD pathogenesis through chronic epithelial damage.",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_014,Describe the neuroimmune mechanisms linking gut microbiota to pain perception and inflammation in IBD,"The gut microbiota modulates neuroimmune mechanisms affecting pain and inflammation through multiple pathways. Pain is a common symptom in IBD, and the overabundance of enteric-associated neurons (EANs) in inflamed bowel regions correlates with colitis severity. The microbiota can modulate gut-extrinsic EANs - depletion of gut microbiome resulted in increased cFos expression (a neuronal activity marker), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Specific bacterial species and their metabolites (SCFAs, bile acids, GLP-1, peptide YY) modulate sympathetic activity and activate brainstem sensory nuclei. TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, which also regulate microbiota composition. Microbial metabolites can regulate activation of brainstem sensory nuclei with polysynaptic connections to the intestine, establishing a gut-brain-gut axis. Additionally, the presence of microbial communities induces AHR expression in EANs, which activates genes regulating neuronal excitability and results in increased intestinal peristaltic activity.",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_015,"How do amino acid-conjugated bile acids differ from traditional bile acids, and what is their significance in Crohn's disease?","New bile acid conjugations with amino acids (phenylalanocholic acid, tyrosocholic acid and leucocholic acid) have been identified through metabolome analysis. These bile acid conjugates were enriched in patients with IBD, particularly in a dysbiotic state from patients with Crohn's disease but not UC. There was a strong positive correlation between the presence of Clostridium bolteae and conjugated bile acids, with certain C. bolteae strains able to synthesize phenylalanocholic acid. In a cell-based system, bile acid conjugates stimulated the FXR receptor and expression of its target genes. Several additional amino acid-conjugated bile acids have been discovered using reverse metabolomics approaches and are increased in patients with CD, produced by bacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera. These novel conjugates represent a distinct mechanism of bile acid modification that may contribute specifically to CD pathogenesis.",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_mcq_009,"Which mechanism is responsible for the protective effect of nociceptors in the gut according to the paper's discussion of TRPV1? Options: A) Direct antimicrobial activity against pathogens B) Regulation of intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides and modulation of microbiota composition C) Enhancement of immune cell recruitment to sites of infection D) Increasing production of digestive enzymes","B. The paper explains that TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role in the gut by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via the release of neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P. Disruption of TRPV1 nociceptors also altered intestinal microbiota composition, and nociceptors release substance P which can regulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
ibd_microbiota_mcq_010,What is the primary mechanism by which the defined 18-member commensal bacterial consortium suppresses intestinal Enterobacteriaceae species? Options: A) Production of antimicrobial peptides B) Competitive depletion of gluconate through a metabolic pathway not present in Enterobacteriaceae C) Direct bacteriocin production D) pH modification of the intestinal environment,"B. The paper describes a consortia of 18 commensal bacterial strains that effectively suppresses intestinal Enterobacteriaceae species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, by competitively depleting gluconate. Gluconate metabolism by species in this consortia involves a pathway of gluconate conversion to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate through enzymatic reactions that are not present in Enterobacteriaceae species commonly found in individuals with IBD. This represents metabolic competition as a therapeutic mechanism.",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,11-Microbiota_in_inflammatory_bowel_disease.pdf
saudi_ibd_012,Compare the findings of this Saudi Arabian study to typical Western IBD microbiome studies and explain why differences might exist,"The study hypothesized that key IBD-associated microbes may be distinctly different in Middle Eastern versus Western populations due to cultural and dietary dissimilarities. Indeed, they observed several microbial genera that were not well characterized in prior IBD studies, including Lachnoclostridium (upregulated in CD), Harryflintia (associated with high-fat diet in mice but less known in CD), and specific patterns of Akkermansia abundance. Only a subset of OTUs were overlapping with UC versus CD characterizations by Jansson and colleagues, suggesting that classification algorithms trained largely on IBD subjects of European ancestry may not perform well when applied to participants from the Middle East. This highlights the importance of population-specific microbiome studies.",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf
saudi_ibd_013,Explain the epidemiological trends of IBD in Saudi Arabia from the 1980s to the study period and the factors contributing to these changes,"Prior to the 1980s, IBD was considered rare in Saudi Arabia and surrounding regions, but the incidence has been gradually increasing over the last four decades. Prospective studies observed an incidence of 5 per million and prevalence of 50 per million for IBD in children from 1993 to 2002. The annual incidence of CD was 3.2 cases per million from 1983 to 1992, rising to 16.6 cases per million from 1993 to 2002. This increase parallels significant changes in industrialization and lifestyle over the last four decades, which greatly impacted dietary and sedentary behaviors. Dietary factors, medication, and smoking are postulated to contribute to the increased CD pathogenesis in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective hospital-based study of 312 Saudi IBD subjects from 1970 to 2008 showed the mean age of patients with IBD was 25.5 (SD 10.6) years.",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf
saudi_ibd_014,Describe the unsupervised discovery methods used and their findings regarding disease classification,"Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, with the broken-stick test indicating that 2 principal components were most meaningful to retain (explaining 9% and 3% of variance, respectively). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that axes 1 and 2 explained 24% and 14% of variance, respectively. A heatmap of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was created and annotated with categorical metadata. Evidence of structure in the data related to differences in community composition was observed, with groups of samples showing clear differences evident by relatively high Bray-Curtis dissimilarity estimates. However, no clear patterns associated with disease status (IBD diagnosis) were evident in either PCoA scatterplots or heatmaps. The study concluded that IBD status was not a main driver of microbiome dissimilarity in this population, with age (R²=0.0665, p=5e-04) and sex (R²=0.0147, p=0.0379) being the only statistically significant factors, though explaining relatively small proportions of variance.",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf
saudi_ibd_015,What were the complete workflow and bioinformatics pipeline used from raw sequencing to final taxonomic classification?,"The workflow began with Illumina software for deconvolution and initial primer/barcode processing. Raw sequences were demultiplexed with Illumina's bcl2fastq2 v2.20 and Seqtk. FastQC was used for quality control to remove samples with low quality scores. The majority of data processing was executed in QIIME2 with custom scripts. Paired-end reads were joined using the VSEARCH function. Chimera amplicon removal and abundance filtering were processed using Deblur. Amplicon sequences were clustered and assembled into OTUs using closed reference clustering against the Greengenes (13_8 database) using VSEARCH. Taxonomic assignment was performed using a pre-trained Naïve Bayes classifier with Greengenes OTU database. The abundance tables from QIIME2 were combined into a Phyloseq object (version 4.1.1), normalized for library size variation using DADA2, and further analyzed in R with custom scripts.

When various metadata fields were fitted onto ordination scores and tested for statistical significance using a permutation test with 10,000 iterations, age was the most significant factor (p-value=5e-04) and explained approximately 7% of the variation (R²=0.0665). Sex was also significant (p-value=0.0379) but only explained approximately 1.5% (R²=0.0147). Notably, disease diagnosis was not statistically significant.",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf

The study evaluated the proportion of uncharacterized OTUs at each taxonomic level and found that approximately 41% of OTUs were uncharacterized at the species level. This high proportion of uncharacterized species-level OTUs led the researchers to agglomerate reads at the genus level for more reliable analysis.,[],,hard,factual,mcq,12-Gut_microbiota_analyses_of_inflammatory_bowel_diseases.pdf
saudi_ibd_mcq_010,What was the key conclusion regarding the applicability of existing IBD classification algorithms to the Saudi Arabian population? Options: A) Existing classifiers performed equally well across all populations B) Classification algorithms trained on European ancestry subjects may not perform well on Middle Eastern participants C) Saudi Arabian microbiome patterns were identical to Western populations D) No differences were observed between populations,"B. The study concluded that only a subset of OTUs were overlapping with UC versus CD characterizations by Jansson and colleagues, and as such, any classification algorithm trained largely on mostly IBD subjects of European ancestry may not perform well when applied to participants from the Middle East.

obesity_microbiota_012,Compare the gut microbiota composition differences between obese adolescents and obese adults in terms of phylum-level distribution,"The distribution of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were statistically significant for the obese adolescent/obese adult comparison, with Actinobacteria levels being higher in the obese adolescent group, and Bacteroidetes levels being uppermost in the obese adult group. At the species level, Actinomyces, Adlercreutzia, Collinsella aerofaciens and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly higher in obese adolescents compared to obese adults",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,13-Gut_Microbiota_Markers_in_Obese_Adolescent_and_Adult_Patients_Obese_.pdf
obesity_microbiota_013,Explain the differential metabolic pathway enrichment between adolescent and adult obese patients and its implications,"Twenty KEGG pathways differentiated adolescent and adult obese patients. Adolescent obese microbiota showed higher lipopolysaccharide metabolism (associated with inflammation and insulin resistance), folate, vitamin B6, inositol phosphate, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Adult obese microbiota showed higher arginine and proline, amino and nucleotide sugar, and starch and sucrose galactose metabolism pathways. This suggests age-dependent metabolic differences in obesity, with adolescents showing more inflammation-related processes while adults show enhanced carbohydrate breakdown pathways",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,13-Gut_Microbiota_Markers_in_Obese_Adolescent_and_Adult_Patients_Obese_.pdf
obesity_microbiota_014,"How does the discriminant analysis model perform in classifying the four study groups, and what does this reveal about microbiota-based classification?","The discriminant analysis showed that 98.6% of the original grouped cases were correctly classified, and the canonical discriminant plot revealed clear separation between obese and control groups. However, when applying cross-validation, only 34.8% of cases were correctly classified, revealing a low capability of the entire OTUs set to discriminate the four groups. This led researchers to select only 12 OTUs (p < 0.05 from Wilks' Lambda test) for better discrimination. The model successfully identified specific markers for obese adolescents and normal weight adolescents (AUROC > 0.7), but could not accurately discriminate adult groups (AUROC < 0.7), suggesting age-dependent microbiota patterns are more distinct in adolescents",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,13-Gut_Microbiota_Markers_in_Obese_Adolescent_and_Adult_Patients_Obese_.pdf
obesity_microbiota_015,What is the relationship between secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways and obesity status in adolescents?,"Secondary bile acid biosynthesis was significantly associated with normal weight adolescents rather than obese adolescents, while primary bile acid biosynthesis was associated with obese adolescents. Primary bile acids (cholate and chenodeoxycholate) are deconjugated by gram-positive bacterial species such as Lactobacilli. After deconjugation, additional microbial modifications by Clostridium species give rise to secondary bile acids, which influence energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis via their effects on gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.

Options: A) To reduce computational time B) To remove OTUs present in less than 25% of samples, ensuring more robust statistical associations C) To focus only on pathogenic bacteria D) To eliminate all Firmicutes from the analysis",B. Operational taxonomic units present in less than 25% of the samples were removed prior to applying statistical analysis to ensure more robust and meaningful statistical associations.

microbiome_richness_012,Compare the discrimination power of gut microbiome versus human genome in distinguishing lean from obese individuals,"For distinguishing lean (BMI < 25 kg/m²) from obese (BMI > 30 kg/m²) individuals, only 15,894 significantly different genes were found, indicating that the gut microbiota differs less between lean and obese than between LGC and HGC individuals. These genes were attributed to 18 bacterial species by clustering. The best AUC achieved was 0.78 with nine species in a ROC analysis with tenfold cross validation. This accuracy, while lower than the 0.98 for LGC/HGC separation, is substantially better than an AUC of 0.58 achieved by ROC analysis of 32 human genome loci associated with adiposity measures, suggesting that the obesity-associated signal in the human gut microbiome is much stronger than that presently known in the human genome",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf
microbiome_richness_013,Describe the validation methods used to confirm that clustered genes originated from the same bacterial species,"Five validation approaches were used: (1) BLASTN taxonomic assignments showed high coherence for genes within clusters; (2) Abundance covariance was computed across Danish (292 individuals) and French (49 individuals) cohorts, showing genes co-varied in both datasets; (3) Abundance similarity was assessed by computing the ratio of standard deviation to mean, showing small scores indicating homogeneity; (4) k-mer composition (tetranucleotide profiles) showed highly correlated profiles for genes within clusters (genes: 1,135 ± 446 bp; contigs: 4,084 ± 3,678 bp); (5) Physical linkage analysis showed that on average 18% of genes from known and unknown clusters were present on the same scaffold, while randomly composed clusters had none (P < 2 × 10^-16)",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf
microbiome_richness_014,What evidence suggests that low gut bacterial richness is associated with multiple chronic diseases beyond obesity?,"Low richness of gut microbiota has been reported in multiple conditions: inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), elderly patients with inflammation, and obese individuals. The study suggests that low-grade inflammation associated with a plethora of chronic diseases may share a common feature of low gut bacterial richness. The LGC phenotype includes features that bring individuals at increased risk of pre-diabetes, type-2 diabetes and ischaemic cardiovascular disorders. The functional capacity suggests LGC individuals harbor an inflammation-associated microbiota, and whether low gut bacterial richness is common to many or all chronic diseases could be revealed by exploring gut microbiota at a deep metagenomic level in a broad variety of these afflictions",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf
microbiome_richness_015,Explain the HITChip analysis results and their concordance with metagenomic sequencing for bacterial richness assessment,"HITChip analysis, based on 16S ribosomal DNA phylogenetic marker, confirmed the bimodal distribution and difference in richness between LGC and HGC individuals. From 3,699 unique HITChip probes, probes accounting for the top 99.9% of total signal were selected and counted for richness measurement, ranging from 713 to 1,597 probes per sample. The correlation with read mapping was very high (Pearson's r of 0.85 and 0.90 in HGC and LGC individuals, respectively). For 33 of 46 genera that differed significantly between groups, genus probes were present on HITChip and their abundance was determined.

The study proposes that altered gut microbiota of LGC individuals induces an increase in serum FIAF (also known as ANGPLT4), eliciting an increased release of triglycerides and free fatty acids. This is supported by observations in rodent models. The median serum FIAF was 88 (72-120) μg/l for LGC versus 78 (60-101) μg/l for HGC individuals (P = 0.0047, q = 0.021)",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,14-Richness_of_human_gut_microbiome_correlates_with_metabolic_markers_Obesity_.pdf

tb_microbiome_011,What is the gut-lung axis and how does it relate to tuberculosis pathogenesis?,"The gut-lung axis refers to the bidirectional relationship where the gut microbiota can influence respiratory diseases and vice versa. Intestinal disorders may affect the lungs through lung inflammation, as both have similar immune messengers and inflammatory processes. The relationship between gut microbiota and respiratory diseases may be related to classic immune inflammatory pathways such as the T cell family and pattern recognition receptors. TNF-α, inflammatory factors such as IL-22 and their regulatory substances constitute the common substance of the intestinal lung axis, which may be related to drug resistance. Intestinal microbiota can regulate the immune response of lung tissue through SCFAs, cytokines, and other factors, thereby affecting the development and outcome of lung diseases including tuberculosis",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,15-Changes_in_gut_microbiome_following_anti-tuberculosis_treatment-_a_prospective_cohort_from_eastern_China.pdf

crc_microbiota_013,How does Fusobacterium nucleatum have contrasting effects on chemotherapy resistance versus immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy?,"F. nucleatum shows paradoxical effects: For chemotherapy, it promotes resistance to both oxaliplatin and 5-FU by eliciting protective autophagy through TLR4–MyD88 signalling and miR-18a*/4802-mediated repression of autophagy genes. It also drives NF-κB signalling and BIRC3 expression, inhibiting apoptosis. However, for immune checkpoint therapy, F. nucleatum paradoxically enhances anti-PD-L1 antibody efficacy. While colonization activates STING–NF-κB signalling and PD-L1 expression in CRC cells, it also promotes CD8+ T cell activation when PD-L1 is inhibited.

Depletion of gut microbiota using antibiotics supports the tumour-suppressive potential of mutant p53 in the distal colon in conditional Trp53R270H-knockin mice, attenuating colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, gut microbiota-derived gallic acid abolishes the tumour-suppressing function of mutant p53 and promotes CRC development in Trp53R270H mice via hyperactivation of WNT signalling.

This enzyme catalyses the formation of galactose both in vitro and in vivo, which impairs glucose utilization and activates oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a 'reverse Warburg' effect.

While microbial markers show good performance for CRC detection (AUCs 0.8-0.9), their main limitation is reduced sensitivity for adenoma detection. For example, F. nucleatum shows AUC 0.89-0.94 for CRC but only ~34% sensitivity for adenomas. Even improved markers like Lachnoclostridium sp. 'm3' show ~50% sensitivity for adenomas.

microbiome_health_013,"Describe the complex cascade of events that leads from respiratory dysbiosis to respiratory exacerbations, including the role of environmental changes, inflammatory responses, and bacterial growth","Respiratory exacerbations are acute events of respiratory dysbiosis accompanied by a dysregulated host immune response. In some disease states, increased airway wall permeability and mucus production introduce nutrient supply to the normally sparse lung environment. The mucus introduces pockets of increased temperature and decreased oxygen tension, selectively favoring the growth of disease-associated microbes. Enhanced immunogenicity exposes airways and alveoli to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and microbial metabolites that provoke further inflammation, which in turn further alters airway conditions. The generation of intraalveolar catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines promotes the growth of select bacterial species such as P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia complex, whereas the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells kills and clears bacteria with variable, species-specific effectiveness.

The beneficial interplay of the host and its microbiome is responsible for maintaining the host's health, whereas disease development is often correlated with microbial dysbiosis or a shift in the microbiota. Pathogens represent only a tiny fraction of microorganisms, whereby the altered composition of the microbiome promotes the emergence and outbreak of pathogens. The vast majority of microbes are crucial for ecosystem functioning as well as beneficial interactions with other microbes, contributing to population dynamics and functional activities. Thus, opportunistic pathogens show that host-microbe interactions depend not only on the host but also on the entire microbiome.

microbiome_health_015,"Analyze the multi-factorial relationship between age, microbiome composition, and disease susceptibility across the human lifespan from infancy to old age","The microbiome changes significantly across the lifespan. In infancy, facultative anaerobes first colonize the gut at birth, creating anaerobic conditions that promote obligate anaerobes like Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides within 2 weeks. Mode of delivery and feeding method (breastfeeding vs formula) significantly affect initial colonization. By age 3, the microbiome resembles that of adults. In prepubescent children, increased hormones during puberty stimulate sebaceous glands, favoring growth of lipophilic microorganisms like Propionibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., and fungal Malassezia spp. This relates to disease susceptibility, with atopic dermatitis related to Staphylococcus more common in prepubescent children, while Malassezia-related tinea versicolor is more prominent in adults. In old age (>65 years), there is a decline in microbiota diversity with reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of Bacteroidetes increases while Firmicutes becomes less abundant. Decreased immune activity makes elderly adults more susceptible to pathogens.

The relatively short length of assembled contigs makes it impractical to determine the genomic origins of these contigs. Many assembled contigs, particularly those corresponding to mobile genetic elements, remain unbinned, obscuring their taxonomic origins. Additionally, because of the total DNA extraction step that typically precedes sequencing library preparation, shotgun metagenomic sequencing does not enable efficient linking of MGEs with bacterial hosts, obscuring community HGT dynamics. These limitations can be addressed through long-read sequencing and Hi-C platforms, which preserve information regarding MGE-bacterial host associations",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf
antibiotic_microbiome_015,How does dietary fiber modulation affect microbiome recovery post-antibiotic treatment?,"Without fibre, mice with a conventional microbiome or a humanized microbiome have a delayed recovery in alpha diversity after ciprofloxacin treatment. In humans, volunteers fed omnivore and vegan diets during combination antibiotic treatment displayed an expedited microbiome recovery (as measured by alpha and beta diversity) relative to those on a fibre-free liquid diet. Specifically, fibre-containing diets encouraged a rapid restoration of stool butyrate levels and a return of Firmicutes with distinct amino acid metabolism. This demonstrates that modulation of polysaccharide or microbiota-accessible carbohydrate levels in diet is highly influential over antibiotic treatment outcomes",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf
antibiotic_microbiome_mcq_009,What property of vancomycin may explain its superior ability to perturb the microbiome compared to other antibiotics? Options: A) Its extremely broad spectrum of activity B) Its poor absorption in mammals and higher concentration in the lumen C) Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier D) Its extended half-life in plasma,B. The superior ability of oral vancomycin administration to perturb the microbiome may be due to its poor absorption in mammals and perhaps higher concentration in the lumen. This occurs despite vancomycin having a narrower in vitro spectrum of activity,[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf
antibiotic_microbiome_mcq_010,"According to the paper, what is a critical consideration for developing narrow-spectrum therapies based on drug combinations? Options: A) Drug combinations always have additive effects B) The combined activity of antibiotic combinations is commonly species-specific and strain-specific C) Only β-lactam antibiotics can be combined effectively D) Drug combinations are always more toxic than single agents","B. A study demonstrated that the combined activity of an antibiotic combination is commonly species specific and strain specific, providing evidence for the possibility of developing narrow-spectrum therapies based on drug combinations. Drug combinations can have differential effects (neutral, synergistic or antagonistic) on the activity of antibiotics against microorganisms, and this modulation is variable across microbial taxa",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,8-Antibiotic_perturbations_to_the_gut_microbiome.pdf
ibd_metabolomics_012,"Compare the metagenomic signatures of CD between pediatric and adult patients, and explain what this reveals about disease pathogenesis","Pediatric CD patients showed significant increases in Ralstonia insidiosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, while showing decreases in Blautia spp. and Coprococcus comes. However, the expected increase in Escherichia coli was not observed in adult CD patients, despite being elevated in pediatric CD (log2FoldChange = 3.45, FDR = 0.007). Pediatric patients had a more consolidated metabolome spectrum than adults, with more homogeneous metabolomic profiles, suggesting a special mechanism of CD development in childhood. The metabolome differences between adults and children may reflect that pediatric CD represents primary alterations, while adult CD may be caused by both endogenous and exogenous factors that dramatically change microbiota. This distinction suggests CD in children has more limited spectrum of metabolic and metagenomic changes, which may enhance prospects for identifying specific pathognomonic factors",[],,hard,comparison,open_ended,9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf
ibd_metabolomics_013,"Explain the diagnostic algorithm developed for pediatric IBD risk assessment, including the mathematical basis and clinical interpretation thresholds","The risk coefficient formula includes metabolites that are significantly different between IBD and control groups. For statistically significant metabolites, biserial correlation was calculated with FDR correction; metabolites with absolute correlation coefficient |r| > 0.3 were included. Positively correlated metabolites were placed in the numerator, negatively correlated ones in the denominator: Kr = log₁₀(1/(pentanoic acid + Phenol,4-methyl + Indole)). ROC analysis determined risk thresholds: values below the 5th percentile indicated no risk (Kr < 4.01), values between 4.01 and 4.79 suggest low risk requiring additional clinical markers, and values above 4.79 (above 25th percentile) indicate high risk requiring further examination and can detect asymptomatic cases. For differential diagnosis, high-risk CD cases show reduced 1H-indole-3-methyl, while UC cases show altered pentanoic acid, phenol 4-methyl, and acetate levels",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf
ibd_metabolomics_014,"Analyze the paradoxical finding that pediatric IBD patients showed greater metabolite diversity than controls, contrary to expectations. What mechanisms might explain this?","Contrary to initial expectations, comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed that the control group had fewer diversely represented volatile metabolites than the IBD group in pediatric patients (opposite to adult patterns). This paradoxical finding may be explained by several factors: (1) therapy being taken by patients may introduce additional metabolites, (2) excessive bacterial growth in IBD provokes secretion of numerous volatile components, (3) treatment-derived xenobiotic metabolites significantly contribute to observed metabolic signatures. While patients with IBD typically have reduced microbiota diversity (which should result in fewer identified metabolites), the overall spectrum of detectable metabolites is actually larger due to these additional factors. In contrast, adults with chronic IBD demonstrate a more stable metabolomic profile reflecting long-term adaptation to disease. This suggests the wide variety of components in pediatric IBD patients reflects acute dysbiosis and therapeutic intervention rather than adaptive microbiome changes",[],,hard,mechanism,open_ended,9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf

Options: A) Akkermansia increased in both UC and CD, promoting inflammation B) Akkermansia showed no significant change across any IBD subtype C) Akkermansia significantly decreased in both UC and CD patients; it has ability to restrain autoimmune reactions and reduce proinflammatory cytokines D) Akkermansia increased only in CD but decreased in UC","C. An important feature identified was a significant decrease in representatives of the genus Akkermansia in patients with both UC and CD. It is known that Akkermansia spp. have the ability to restrain autoimmune reactions and reduce proinflammatory cytokines, making its depletion significant for IBD pathogenesis",[],,hard,mechanism,mcq,9-Combined_metabolomic_and_metagenomic_analysis.pdf
