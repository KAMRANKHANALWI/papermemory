Which oral-typical species was significantly associated with late-stage CRC but NOT with early-stage CRC? Options: A) Gemella morbillorum B) Fusobacterium nucleatum C) Parvimonas micra D) Dialister pneumosintes,"['. We found 17 SGBs associated with late CRC, but only four associated with early CRC (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 6). Among the for- mer were five SGBs of oral origin: Slackia exigua SGB14784, P. micra SGB6653, Solobacterium SGB6833, Dialister pneumosintes SGB5842 and Streptococcus mutans SGB8000. Interestingly, P. micra SGB6653 was already increased in stage I, along with G. morbillorum SGB7295, while F. nucleatum SGB6007, despite being significantly increased in stage I, appeared to be consistently more abundant starting in stage II of CRC (Supplementary Table 8). We note that stage-specific taxa are usually part of the whole CRC versus healthy state signature (8 of the 17 significant SGBs between early versus late CRC) indicating a continuum in microbiome trends along stages rather than distinct configurations. Among the nine SGBs significantly more abundant in stage IV, H. hathewayi SGB4741 showed the greatest increase in abundance (Fig', '. Further evidence points toward the enrichment of oral-typical microbes (at the genus level21) and of oral biofilm-forming species22 in the gut metagenomes of patients with proximal CRC. However, no metagenomic studies have gone beyond characterizing already well-known strain-specific factors influenc- ing CRC risk (for example, pks island, fragilysin), and no untargeted searches for subspecies and strain-level genomic associations with Received: 10 April 2024 Accepted: 2 April 2025 Published online: 3 June 2025 Check for updates e-mail: nicola.segata@unitn.it A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper', '. rimae SGB985 S. wiggsiae SGB15494 A. segnis SGB9738 g.

Bacterial biomarkers for CRC encompassed not only known associations, such as Parvimonas micra, Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (SMD = 0.63, 0.59 and 0.58, respectively)18, but also newly associated SGBs such as multi- ple genomically distinct F. nucleatum SGBs (SGB6007 (Fna C2 in ref. 23), F. nucleatum animalis, SGB6014 F. nucleatum vincentii, SGB6011 a Average Feng, Q.

Here, we present some of the top hits from the model with Collinsella aerofaciens SGB14546, Clostridium fessum SGB4705 and F. prausnitzii 15318 (c) for the metastatic comparisons, and R. bicirculans SGB4262 (d) in late stages. Similar to b, the inner ring is the CRC stage, while tips are metastatic status and early or late, respectively, and the outer ring is the mean posterior phylogenetic effect (full model results from Anpan are given in Supplementary Table 10). e, Significant gene carriage differences by taxon associations in R. bicirculans (Anpan, q < 0.05 and abs(estimate) > 1). Genes differentially carried by R. bicirculans included those in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA mobility, and response to oxidative environments; all genes were found to be more present in late-stage CRC (III–IV) than in early-stage CRC (0–III).', '. No oral SGB was associated with controls and a greater proportion of oral SGBs were associated with CRC at lower q thresholds (18 of 90 at q < 0.05). By reconstructing strain- and subspecies-level phylogenies for oral-typical species associ- ated with CRC via PhyloPhlAn 3 (ref. 30) using metagenome-assembled genomes and isolates, we further identified several subclades of taxa that appear to be more prevalent in the oral cavity or the gut, including clades of F. nucleatum SGB6007 and three Veillonella species (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Within oral species, there is thus evidence of genomic adaptation to the intestinal environment. In addition, to better char- acterize the tropism of the 21 oral SGBs that are more abundant in CRC (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we exploited datasets with dental plaque and tongue dorsum metagenomes from the same individuals31', '. Dominant strain carriage was particularly associated with CRC stages, with many species (27 of the 213 tested) having significant phylogenetic associations with metastatic disease, all of which were independent of significant species-level abundance changes during CRC. Although even larger investigations are needed to assess the extent to which these strain associations are clinically relevant, they provide targeted potential mechanisms to be validated. We found several common patterns across multiple lines of investi- gation. These included the role of orally derived bacteria in shaping the gut microbiome in CRC, as previously observed at lower resolution18. We not only strengthened the notion that the number and cumulative abundance of orally derived species are significantly higher in CRC samples than controls and adenomas, but also found that later stages of CRC were particularly enriched for oral species', '. The strongest signals from this phylogenetic lineage analysis dif- ferentiated early and late CRC, as well as metastatic and nonmetastatic CRC (Fig. 6a). All species identified as having subclades associated with early or late CRC were also identified in the metastatic–nonmetastatic comparisons, likely indicating that stage IV is a driver of these differ- ences, which can also be observed across the two highlighted species, R. bicirculans (Fig. 6d) and Clostridium fessum (Fig. 6c). In addition, R. bicirculans was a top hit in both models and was found through the gene carriage model to also carry genes in CRC (Anpan taxon-wise q < 0.1 and abs(estimate) > 1) (Fig. 6d). Of potential interest, we identified sev- eral genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism as having higher car- riage by R. bicirculans strains in later stages of CRC (Fig', '. 4d). This underscores a difference in microbiome composition that can be relevant for side-specific mechanistic models. Among the 61 tumor location differential SGBs (q < 0.1), we found that three oral-typical SGBs (Veillonella parvula SGB6939, Veillonella atypica SGB6936 and Trueperella pyogenes SGB17137) were signifi- cantly increased in right-sided CRC (Fig. 4e Supplementary Table 6). In addition, seven of the ten SGBs associated with right-sided CRC (q < 0.1) were nonoral SGBs. Among these, we identified Streptococcus para- sanguinis SGB8071, which was shown to form biofilms with Veillonella spp.39, suggesting that such interactions may be more characteristic of right-sided CRC22. Importantly, only a few SGBs were found in common when comparing the signature for primary tumor location with CRC stages: Christensenellaceae NSJ_44 SGB7265 and P. micra SGB6653 when considering early versus late stages (Fig. 4f), and Clostridia SGB15390, Clostridium sp', '. In total, we detected 3,866 bacterial, 15 eukaryotic and 23 archaeal SGBs. Some bacterial species spanned multiple SGBs, as was the case for CRC-associated F. nucleatum species for which five SGBs described known and unknown subspecies found by MetaPhlAn 4 (that is, SGB6001, SGB6007, SGB6011, SGB6013, SGB6014), with SGB6007 and SGB6013 recently independently investigated23 and corresponding to F. nucleatum subspecies animalis (Fna) clade 2 (C2) and Fna clade 1 (C1)23. To test the relevance of the presence and overall abundance of oral microbial species in the CRC gut ecosystem, we defined a panel of typically oral SGBs. These were defined on an independent set of 990 matched oral and stool samples from 495 healthy individuals in 5 public microbiome studies27 (Methods). In particular, we considered oral SGBs to be those prevalent (>20%) in the oral microbiome but not (<5%) in the gut microbiome (Methods and Supplementary Table 3)', '. Only four SGBs were uncharacterized at the species level (that is, belonging to known genera): Solobacterium SGB6833 (distinct form the previously associated Solobacterium moorei18), Peptostreptococcus SGB749 and two Porphyromonas SGBs. The effect sizes of the signature identified via meta-analysis significantly correlated with the average ranks of the LODO-evaluated ML models (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.41, P < 0.001) (Extended Data Fig. 4), thus supporting the robustness and consistency of the two independent approaches. A considerable fraction of the identified CRC gut biomarkers were oral-typical species: 21 of the 125 SGBs (16.8%) positively associated with CRC were oral-typical, in contrast to 34 of 488 (7.0%) nonsignificantly associated with CRC (Fisher’s test, P < 0.01). No oral SGB was associated with controls and a greater proportion of oral SGBs were associated with CRC at lower q thresholds (18 of 90 at q < 0.05)', '. Discussion We analyzed the gut microbiota of CRC patients and identified novel prognostic bacteria, including Prevotella, two Alistipes spp., P. piscolens, and D. invisus, in addition to the already implicated F. nucleatum. Expanding the repertoire of non-invasive biomarkers is necessary for early diagnosis and proper prognosis of CRC; however, only a few studies have profiled the overall microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing [11]. The prognos- tic value of F. nucleatum and B. fragilis was reproduced in a study sequencing 180 CRC biopsies [12]; slightly improved survival was observed in 23 patients with the high Prevotella co-abundance group, albeit insignificant [13]. We show for the first time the significant associa- tion between an enterotypical genus Prevotella and CRC prognosis. Human gut microbiota is classified into two entero- types, represented by the genera Bacteroides and Prevo- tella [35]', '. Here, we aimed to identify novel prognostic bacteria for CRC by examining the preoperative gut microbiota through 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results: We collected stool samples from 333 patients with primary CRC within 2 weeks before surgery and followed up the patients for a median of 27.6 months for progression and 43.6 months for survival. The sequence and progno‑ sis data were assessed using the log-rank test and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. The gut microbiota was associated with the clinical outcomes of CRC patients (Pprogress = 0.011, Pdecease = 0.007). In particular, the high abundance of Prevotella, a representative genus of human enterotypes, indicated lower risks of CRC progression (P = 0.026) and decease (P = 0.0056), while the occurrence of Alistipes assigned to Bacteroides sp., Pyramidobacter piscolens, Dialister invisus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum indicated a high risk of progression', '.

This suggests that while it is associated with early-stage CRC, it may not be a specific marker for late-stage CRC.

However, another option is correct: F. nucleatum SGB6007 was significantly increased in stage I, but appeared to be consistently more abundant starting in stage II of CRC (Supplementary Table 8). But the text also mentions that ""F. nucleatum SGB6007, despite being significantly increased in stage I, appeared to be consistently more abundant starting in stage II of CRC"". This suggests that F. nucleatum is associated with both early and late-stage CRC.

"According to the paper, what is a critical consideration for developing narrow-spectrum therapies based on drug combinations? Options: A) Drug combinations always have additive effects B) The combined activity of antibiotic combinations is commonly species-specific and strain-specific C) Only β-lactam antibiotics can be combined effectively D) Drug combinations are always more toxic than single agents","['. Alternatively, antibiotic-mediated destruction of the microbiome can be prevented by bioengineering approaches targeting the antibiotic. Specifically, the gut concentrations of the drugs can be diminished through enzymatic degradation or physical sequestration of antibiotics, preventing a broader reduction in the richness and diversity of the gut community. Last, the narrowing of the spectrum of activity of the treatment regimen might also prevent broader damage to the gut microbial community. This could be achieved by choosing antibiotics with inherently narrower activity spectra or through combinations of antibiotics with other drugs, which may similarly result in a narrower spectrum of antimicrobial activity.', '.

These con- flicting reports are likely to arise from the difficulty of disentangling the effects of antibiotics on HGT rates from the antibiotic-mediated selection of transconjugants (Fig. 3), which suggests that the reported post-antibiotic enrichments of ARG-encoding MGEs often result from the growth advantage conferred on transconjugants, not higher HGT rates per se162. Investigation of HGT rates within the gut microbiome is still in its nascency; our understanding of how the frequency of horizontal transfer is affected by antibiotics is very limited, let alone our grasp on the variability of this impact across drug classes. Further investigation into the effects of antibiotics on HGT are needed, with careful experi- mental design that enables the precise determination of the frequency of HGT while controlling for the effects of antibiotics on other aspects of bacterial biology (such as the growth rate)', '. The MDR-TB treatment for the patients was individualized and generally included one injection drug of kanamycin, amikacin or capreomycin, and four oral drugs (pyrazinamide, one ﬂuoroquinolone drug of levoﬂoxacin or moxiﬂoxacin, and two second-line oral bacteriostatic drugs of prothionamide, cyloserine or para-aminosalicylic acid). A detailed description of the individualized MDR-TB treatment used in our participants was provided in Supplementary Table S1. The microbiota richness, diversity and evenness were calculated at the OTU level. The microbiota richness was measured by ACE, which was based on the presence of the OTU. The results showed a decreased ACE in the treated group (p = 0.025) and in the recovered group (p = 0.018) compared to their corresponding control groups (Figure 1A). The microbiota diversity was measured by a Shannon index, which was based on both the number and the evenness of the observed OTUs', '. difficile infection compared to the patients receiving placebo after antibiotics (12% vs 40%).352 Patients receiving SER-109 showed an engraftment of the dosed species within 1 week, which persisted for the study duration (8 weeks) with an increased abundance of Firmicutes and decreased proinflammatory Enterobacteriaceae. A higher concentration of secondary bile acids in the fecal samples from patients given SER-109 was also observed.352 3.3.2. Synthetic Microbial Consortia. Due to the undefined community structure in naturally occurring micro- biomes, it is challenging to quantify the contributions of individual members toward a specific function, making it unsuitable for further optimization. Synthetic microbial consortia can fulfill this unmet need as they can be rationally designed with reduced microbial complexity to perform functions that can predictably impart a therapeutic benefit to the host. For example, Tanoue et al', '. MDR-TB treatment consists of a variety of narrow-spectrum and broad-spectrum antibiotics and lasts for at least 20 months. A course of treatment consists of an 8-month intensive treatment with one injection drug from kanamycin, amikacin or capreomycin, and four oral drugs from ﬁrst-line drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, and rifapentine), ﬂuoroquinolones (levoﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin, and gatiﬂoxacin) and second- line oral bacteriostatic drugs (ethionamide, prothionamide, cycloserine, terizidone, para-aminosalicylic acid, and para- aminosalicylate sodium). Then the administration of the four oral antibiotic drugs continues for another 12 months (World Health Organization, 2014)', '. Given this potential, we discuss the use of engineered pro- biotic therapies with demonstrated anti-pathogen activity167,168. Based on the shortcomings of many of these approaches, or the likelihood of community evolution to outpace a given therapy, we expect that the most successful therapies in the future are likely to come from a combination of approaches in mitigating gut dysbiosis and preventing gastrointestinal infections. Minimizing antibiotic-induced perturbations to the gut Given that antibiotics vary in their spectrum of activity against the diverse members of the commensal gut microbiome, the choice of treat- ments with a narrower spectrum could result in less perturbation to the microbiome and faster community recovery169.

The chart on the right depicts transconjugants as a fraction of the total cells in the community. b,c, During antibiotic treatment, either conjugation rates are increased (part b) or selection promotes the growth of plasmid-containing populations (part c); these two outcomes could also take place concurrently. Both cases result in a higher fraction of transconjugants relative to the community in the absence of antibiotics. This leads to difficulties in distinguishing the effects of antibiotics on conjugation rates from those of antibiotic-mediated selection.', '. Assessment of gut microbiome composition is confounded by numerous host, microbial and environmental factors (both technical and biological), rendering comparisons of the reported effects of different antibiotics on the gut across studies currently intractable. Our understanding of the differential impact of antibiotics is largely informed by investigations in which multiple treatment agents are analysed in the same study population39,46,55,56. For instance, vancomycin has been shown to cause a significant decrease in alpha diversity (more than twofold at the operational taxonomic unit level), an increase in primary bile acids (approximately threefold in faecal levels) and a decrease in the stool butyrate and acetate levels (more than fivefold and approximately twofold, respectively) relative to amoxicillin39,55; para- doxically, of the two drugs, vancomycin has a narrower in vitro spec- trum of activity', 'Nature Reviews Microbiology | Volume 21 | December 2023 | 772–788 786 Review article 109.

Finally, medications, especially antibiotics, will directly affect the gut microbiota and subsequently the gut–brain axis. Besides antibiotics, a growing number of studies also showed that nonantibiotic drugs can change the gut–microbiota composition, as well as neurophysiology and behavior.89 In a large-scale gut- microbiota project named the Belgian Flemish Gut Flora Project, antibiotics, osmotic laxatives, hormones, benzodiazepines, anti- depressants, antihistamines, and inﬂammatory bowel disease drugs were found to be highly relevant to the variation of gut microbiota.90 Other studies also showed that proton pump inhibitors, metformin, and statins can impact gut microbiota.91 Moreover, due to the rise of interest in the gut–brain axis, more and more psychotropic medications were discovered to have antimicrobial activities. Examples are serotonin antagonists such as sertraline, paroxetine, and ﬂuoxetine, which have antimicrobial Microbiota in health and diseases Hou et al', '. Then the administration of the four oral antibiotic drugs continues for another 12 months (World Health Organization, 2014). Gut microbiota plays an important role in human health, involving in the development of immune system, the regulation of metabolism, the protection from pathogen overgrowth, the regulation of intestinal endocrine hormone, the biosynthesis of vitamins and the provision of energy (Sommer and Backhed, 2013). There is growing concern about the negative eﬀects of antibiotics on gut microbiota and human health. Antibiotic administration has a catastrophic disturbance on intestinal microbiota (Francino, 2016). Altered abundance of 30% gut bacteria and decreased richness, diversity and evenness of the whole gut bacteria can be induced by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Dethlefsen et al., 2008). After discontinuing the antibiotics, gut microbiota can either return to the composition before the treatment or achieve a new equilibrium (Sommer et al., 2017)', '. 4. ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR MICROBIOME RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING Many studies including the examples mentioned in section 3 support the feasibility of engineered microbe therapy for microbiome-related diseases.368−371 However, despite many proof-of-concept studies, several clinical trials using engineered microbes could not show efficacy or were terminated due to a lack of efficacy in the Phase 2 trials (e.g., NCT03447730, NCT03234465, and NCT03447730). One contributing factor toward the lack of efficacy in these engineered microbes may be the absence of regulatory mechanisms. Typically, these mechanisms control the expression of exogenous genes under stable promoters in the microbiome to enhance efficacy or reduce side effects. One of the advantages of utilizing microbes as therapeutics is their high programmability compared to conventional chemical medicine', '. Azithromycin has been widely explored (in clinical trials of >1,000 children across sub-Saharan Africa) on its own and in comparison to other antibiotics60–66. In a comparative study, azithromycin leads to a greater decrease in Simpson’s alpha diversity (less than twofold) 5 days post-treatment than amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole67. More recently, in healthy adult volunteers, microbiome analysis during four different antibiotic regimens identified that azithromycin-containing regimens were associated with delayed community recovery following treat- ment relative to the regimens without azithromycin33. Understanding perturbation differences between regimens will be critical to enhanc- ing antibiotic stewardship, and future studies incorporating more control over antibiotic administration parameters (for example, route of exposure, duration, dose or bioavailability) will be imperative for influencing antibiotic stewardship']","The correct answer is:

B) The combined activity of antibiotic combinations is commonly species-specific and strain-specific

"Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a beneficial function of gut microbiota? Options: A) Synthesis of essential vitamins including biotin, folate, and vitamin K B) Neutralization of carcinogenic compounds C) Direct production of human hormones like insulin D) Defense against pathogen colonization","['. For example, current advances have shown that human micro- biota is closely involved in nutrient extraction, metabolism, and immunity.15 Microbiota may affect biological processes via several mechanisms. For energy and nutrient extraction from food, microbiota plays crucial roles due to the versatile metabolic genes which provide independent unique enzymes and biochemical pathways.16 Moreover, the biosynthesis of bioactive molecules such as vitamins, amino acids and lipids, are also highly dependent on the gut microbiota.17 Regarding the immune system, the human microbiota not only protects the host from external pathogens by producing antimicrobial substances but also serves as a signiﬁcant component in the development of intestinal mucosa and immune system. In healthy conditions, the gut microbiota exhibits stability, resilience, and symbiotic interaction with the host', '. The GI microbiota is also crucial to the de novo synthesis of essential vitamins which the host is incapable of producing [149]. Lactic acid bacteria are key organisms in the production of vitamin B12, which cannot be synthesised by either animals, plants or fungi [149,150]. Biﬁdobacteria are main producers of folate, a vitamin involved in vital host metabolic processes including DNA synthesis and repair [151]. Further vitamins, which gut microbiota have been shown to synthesise in humans, include vitamin K, riboﬂavin, biotin, nicotinic acid, panthotenic acid, pyridoxine and thiamine [152]. Colonic bacteria can also metabolise bile acids that are not reabsorbed for biotransformation to secondary bile acids [113]. All of these factors will inﬂuence host health. For example, an alteration of the co-metabolism of bile acids, branched fatty acids, choline, vitamins (i.e', '1 3 Diabetologia (2024) 67:1760–1782 Essential functions of microbes Besides being a potential deleterious threat for mammals, gut microbes also provide essential functions for mammals, including the education of the immune system, protection from pathogens (i.e. colonisation resistance) [104], meta- bolic functions, and the supply of nutrients (e.g. vitamins [105]), gut motility, and detoxification of xenobiotics [106]. At the same time, there is competition between microbes and the host for nutrients in the small intestine, and microbially produced macronutrient byproducts are provided to the host. Nutrients (i.e. fibres) and mammalian metabolites such as glucuronides, mucous polysaccharides, and bile acids are fermented or transformed by microbial metabolism (Fig. 1) [107]', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 FIGURE 1 Gut microbial strains and negative health outcomes of gut microbial dysbiosis. from H2 processed by bacterial metabolism. It is a prominent and essential Archean in the gut microbiota (Hoﬀmann et al., 2013; Berry, 2016). Some of the beneﬁcial functions of gut microbiota for human health are shown in Figure 2. It is considered that diet is a signiﬁcant factor associated with health and disease control, but some recent studies concluded that diet is pivotal for shaping the gut microbial structure and inﬂuencing the metabolism of the host. The gut environment, sequentially, can help reproduce, grow, and survive the microbial community (Browne et al., 2016). Carbohydrates are an essential and signiﬁcant energy source; also, intestinal microbiota has provided a fermentation stage to deliver vital biomolecules to the host (Conlon and Bird, 2015)', '. An unhealthy diet intake, such low intakes of fruits and vegetables intakes and overuse of antibiotics can result in dysbiosis. In nutshell, probiotics aid in the treatment of various infectious diseases, dysfunctions of the GI tract, and inﬂammatory disorders as well as in controlling obesity and diabetes. The advances in gut microbiota modeling and analysis will enhance our knowledge of how they inﬂuence health and disease, allowing us to adapt current and forthcoming therapeutic and preventive strategies. Understanding the speciﬁc roles played by the gut microbiome in our growth and development, as well as how it functions in health and disease, holds the potential to improve many parts of our daily lives, from improving the formula for infants to oﬀering new approaches in ﬁghting obesity and cancer, among others', '. Propionate is also an essential energy source for the epithelial cells in the liver; it plays a vital role in gluconeogenesis (Cani, 2018). Acetate helps in the growth of other bacteria as an essential co-factor; for example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii will not grow in pure culture in the absence of acetate (Rowland et al., 2018). Human gut microbiota can also synthesize essential vitamins, including biotin, folate, and vitamin K, and neutralize carcinogenic compounds, such as pyro lysates (Selber-Hnatiw et al., 2017). Various indications specify that the host metabolism is mainly aﬀected by multiple microbial metabolites that bind to speciﬁc host membranes or nuclear receptors (Bhutia et al., 2017). Some of the most important metabolites produced by gut microbiota are described in Table 1', '.

In the current review, we mainly focus on the function of microbiota in human health and diseases. The composition of microbiota varies from site to site (depicted in Fig. 1). Gut microbiota is considered the most signiﬁcant one in maintaining our health.4 The gut bacteria serve several functions, such as fermentation of food, protection against pathogens, stimulating immune response, and vitamin production.5 Generally, the gut microbiota is composed of 6 phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, among which Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the major types.6 The most studied fungi (gut mycobiota) are Candida, Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Cladosporium.7 In addition to bacteria and fungi, the human gut microbiota also contain viruses, phages, and archaea, mainly M. smithii.8 While less well established compared with gut, microbiota is also localized in other regions including the oral cavity, lung, vagina, and skin', '. Some of the most important metabolites produced by gut microbiota are described in Table 1. The majority of essential functions for host physiology and maintenance are associated with gut microbiota, e.g., the nervous system’s development, intestinal development, appetite regulation, etc. Gut microbiota in immune homeostasis The contribution of the human gut microbiota to various aspects of human health, especially the immune system, is crucial for providing the host with several essential beneﬁts. Recent studies have found that early development of the gut microbiota is crucial in preventing autoimmune disorders and proper immune functioning (Lazar et al., 2018; Spencer et al., 2019; Elmassry et al., 2020; Schluter et al., 2020). The intestinal microbiome is essential for the maturation of the immune system, which includes adaptive and innate immune responses', '. Concluding Remarks In conclusion, dietary ﬁbers can be considered key ancestral compounds that preserve gut ecology, especially regulating macronutrients and host physiology. Screening novel ﬁbers, both extracted and puriﬁed from food as well as those selectively modiﬁed or synthesized, for their potential as the next-genera- tion prebiotics, and deﬁning efﬁcient strategies to reintroduce high amount of ﬁbers aiming at replenishing the gut microbiome with essential missing microbes, will be the next challenge to signiﬁcantly impact gut microbiota-associated human diseases. Finally, a better understanding of diet-microbiota interactions will help to develop a personalized nutrition approach that would target and reduce more efﬁciently the incidence of chronic in- ﬂammatory diseases. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We are grateful to Anna Halle´ n for producing the ﬁgures', '. Typhimurium and C. difﬁcile, due to an alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability favouring their expansion into the gut [135]. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the antibiotic-induced blooms of bacteria and the biochemical activities and metabolites affected will help develop complementary and/or alternative strategies required for maintaining human health. Role of the GI microbiota in health Owing to its large genomic content and metabolic complement, the gut microbiota provides a range of beneﬁ- cial properties to the host. Some of the most important roles of these microbes are to help to maintain the integrity of the mucosal barrier, to provide nutrients such as vitamins or to protect against pathogens. In add- ition, the interaction between commensal microbiota and the mucosal immune system is crucial for proper immune function', '. Micronutrients, in addition to macronutrients, may play a key role in gut reshaping, according to various studies (Ramos and Martín, 2021). All of these ﬁndings point to the importance of dietary factors as modulators of the microbial community, which can therefore have an impact on human physiology and disease processes. Conclusion The crucial role of probiotics in health, disease, and nutrition has increased their scientiﬁc and marketing signiﬁcance across the globe. The attention has been shifted from prospective studies to clinical trials to have a better understanding of how microbiota can interplay in human health and disease. Eubiosis is important in exerting the health endorsing beneﬁts of probiotics. An unhealthy diet intake, such low intakes of fruits and vegetables intakes and overuse of antibiotics can result in dysbiosis', '. Then the administration of the four oral antibiotic drugs continues for another 12 months (World Health Organization, 2014). Gut microbiota plays an important role in human health, involving in the development of immune system, the regulation of metabolism, the protection from pathogen overgrowth, the regulation of intestinal endocrine hormone, the biosynthesis of vitamins and the provision of energy (Sommer and Backhed, 2013). There is growing concern about the negative eﬀects of antibiotics on gut microbiota and human health. Antibiotic administration has a catastrophic disturbance on intestinal microbiota (Francino, 2016). Altered abundance of 30% gut bacteria and decreased richness, diversity and evenness of the whole gut bacteria can be induced by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Dethlefsen et al., 2008). After discontinuing the antibiotics, gut microbiota can either return to the composition before the treatment or achieve a new equilibrium (Sommer et al., 2017)', '. and Rossi, M.

Although more clinical studies are required to examine and deeply understand the mechanism through which gut microbiota contribute to IBD progression. Eubiosis and food Dietary eﬀects and inﬂuences on our gut microbiome are not new subjects of research. Food causes transient changes in the gut microbiota composition, which are primarily due to ﬁsh, meat, and ﬁber, which have long-term eﬀects (Bajinka et al., 2020). More than two macronutrients can be found in one diet, which alters the gut microbiota while also altering metabolic output (Qiu et al., 2020). The positive beneﬁts of dietary ﬁber on human metabolism have been explored and found to be signiﬁcant. Dietary ﬁber has been shown to alter the microbiota and produce beneﬁcial metabolites like butyrate (Silva et al., 2020)']","The correct answer is:

Options: A) They were found in completely different patient groups with no overlap B) A. senegalensis covered all A. dispar-positive patients C) Seven ASVs belonging to Alistipes covered all Bacteroides sp.-positive patients D) They showed opposite prognostic effects on CRC outcomes,"['Page 6 of 14 Huh et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:203 Alistipes covered all patients who are positive of Bacte- roides sp. (Figure S3A). A phylogenetic tree was generated with the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences of Bacteroides sp. and 14 type strains of Alistipes species. The Alistipes ASVs assigned to Bacteroides sp. consisted of A. dispar and A. senegalensis (Figure S3C). Both the species distinguished poor outcomes as separate indicators (PA. dispar = 0.00012, PA. senegalensis = 0.017; Figure S3D and E). A gut microbiota‑derived hazard score accurately predicts CRC prognosis To generate a robust microbial hazard score (MHS) by combining the prognostic bacteria, we randomly sampled half of the original dataset 1000 times; we applied 31 different combinations of MHS to the pool of test datasets (Fig. 3A)', 'infections (Yoshida et al., 2018; Cobo et al., 2022). Its accurate identiﬁcation is challenging due to its close relationship with P. vulgatus (96% similarity), one of the most numerically predominant Bacteroides species in the human intestine (Pedersen et al., 2013; Vu et al., 2022). Unlike P. (B.) dorei, other top TB-associated species, such as E. coli, A. muciniphila, and M. funiformis, are relatively better studied and were previously implicated in various diseases, such as inﬂammatory bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease and colitis), metabolic syndromes (obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes), autism, and infections (diarrhea, cystitis) (Sheng et al., 2022) (Zou et al., 2020). We next inspected the relative abundance of these top discriminatory species. We noted that some healthy donors carried high proportions of TB-associated species, such as Phocaeicola dorei, Escherichia coli, and Prevotella copri clade C (Figure 3A, asterisk)', 'Page 5 of 14 Huh et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:203 a prevalence ≥ 10% and relative abundance ≥ 0.01%. The screening was conducted using both total samples and random subsamples (1000 times) (Fig. 2E). Log- rank test with total samples revealed that Bacteroides sp., F. nucleatum, Dialister invisus, and Pyramidobacter piscolens indicate an increased risk of progression and death (Fig. 2F–J and Figure S2C); those species signifi- cantly predicted disease progression after adjustment for multiple confounding factors—TNM stages, lymphatic invasion, neoadjuvant treatment, postoperative chemo- therapy, and the level of CEA (adjusted \xadHRP.pis 2.52 \xad[aHRP. pis], \xadaHRD.inv 2.30, \xadaHRF.nuc 2.04, \xadHRB.sp. 1.86; Fig. 2J). In the random subsampling method, also known as the Monte Carlo CV, the number of consistent discrimina- tion (P < 0.05) in both discovery and validation sets was used to measure the robustness of biomarker species', '. As a result, the four prognostic biomarkers were the most overrepresented ones in log-rank test and multivariate CoxPH (Fig. 2J), which collectively suggested that they are potent and robust biomarkers.

The PTB and HC groups had statistically signiﬁcant differences in ﬁve predominant phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Acti- nobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The rela- tive abundances (proportions) of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were 63.81% and 27.82% in the HC group and 48.84% and 44.92% in the PTB group respectively (Fig. 2A). At the family level, the PTB group had signiﬁcantly greater abundances of Bacteroidaceae (30.36% vs. 17.19%, q = 0.004), Tannerellaceae (2.38% vs. 0.94%, q = 0.019), Fusobacteriaceae (2.15% vs. 0.17%, q = 0.014) and Erysipelotrichaceae (1.44% vs. 0.89%, q = 0.034) than the HCs group.

A. dispar and A. senegalensis, which are taxonomically assigned to Bacteroides sp. according to the latest SILVA 138 database, are additional biomarkers for dismal out- comes. Alistipes is a relatively new bacterial genus that branches off from Bacteroides and is associated with many diseases in both protective and pathogenic ways [47]. In CRC, Alistipes is increased in the carcinoma tissues compared to that in the healthy controls and advanced adenomas [48]. We suggested microbiota-derived thiamine (vita- min B1) as a beneficial micronutrient for CRC through computational inference (PPWY-6897= 0.0087, PTHISYN- PWY = 0.087; Fig. 4D and Figure S5A). Low intake of thiamine is associated with increased CRC risk, and high doses of thiamine suppress cancer cell prolifera- tion in vitro [49, 50].

Enterotypical Prevotella and four opportunists indicate a state of CRC patients The patients were followed up for the median of 27.6 months for CRC progression and the median of 42.7 months for survival.

Enterotype 1 showed shorter pro- gression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than enterotype 2 (PPFS = 0.05, POS = 0.15; Fig. 2A, B). Among the enterotypical bacteria, the patients with a higher abundance of Prevotella had a lower risk of CRC progression and death (PPFS = 0.026, POS = 0.0056; Fig. 2C and D); however, the abundances of Bacteroides (PPFS = 0.39, POS = 0.45) and Faecalibacterium (PPFS = 0.95, POS = 0.77) had little impact on PFS and OS (Figure S2A and B). Patients with CRC have microbial dysbiosis with an increased appearance of opportunistic pathobi- onts [23]. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with poor prognosis harbor more pathobionts', '.

All the participants were 18 years and above who were newly diagnosed microscopically with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB group and later conﬁrmed with sputum culture and molecular identiﬁcation) and healthy control volunteers (Control group), with no TB disease or no latent TB infection as conﬁrmed by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (QFT- Plus; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)', ', Fann University Hospital Center, Dakar, Senegal, 7Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, South African Medical Research Council Centre for Tuberculosis, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa, 8Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States Background: Individuals with a history of tuberculosis (TB) treatment are at a higher risk of experiencing a recurrent episode of the disease', '. In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people worldwide were afflicted with tuberculosis, with 69% concentrated in Southeast Asia (45%) and Africa (23%). In 2022, 1.3 million people died from tuberculosis, making it the sec- ond leading cause of death from infectious diseases, fol- lowing COVID-19 [2]. Data from 2023 indicates that the estimated number of new tuberculosis cases worldwide rose to 10.8 million, marking the return of tuberculosis being the world’s leading cause of death from a single infectious agent again [3]. Compared to 2015, the global incidence rate in 2023 had only decreased by 8.3%, far below the target set by the “End TB” strategy [3]. China ranks third in the world for the number of tuberculosis cases [4]. This position highlights the significant burden in the country, which remains a public health challenge despite ongoing efforts to control and eliminate the dis- ease', '. We aimed to recruit a cohort of drug-susceptible people with tubercu- losis to characterize the short- and long-term effects of anti- tuberculosis treatment on the gut microbiome. Methods Study design and participants From October 2020 to December 2022, a multi-center, prospective cohort study was conducted at four tuber- culosis -designated hospitals across Jiangsu Province, eastern China. Considering geographical, demographic, and economic variations, we selected four cities (Wuxi, Changzhou, Taizhou and Xuzhou city) across southern, central, and northern Jiangsu Province as research sites. From these selected tuberculosis designated hospitals, we randomly selected eligible participants who met the inclusion criteria of our study. New people with tuber- culosis were diagnosed according to clinical symptoms based on The National Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (WS 288–2017). People with', '. Finally, Cohort 3 (cross sectional and observational) consists of healthy volunteers. These healthy volunteers were enrolled separately. Around half are healthy and TB-negative household or family contacts (FC) of active TB-patients, and the other half are community controls (CC), with no know TB exposure. We performed microbiome proﬁling and peripheral transcriptomics on these individuals as well. B Numbers of individuals in this study. C Diagram showing the major questions investigated in this study.

BMC Infectious Diseases (2025) 25:453 Studies on the dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of peo- ple with tuberculosis have drawn growing attention in recent years [10, 17, 22–38]. These studies have encom- passed: (i) case control studies involving healthy controls and people with tuberculosis and (ii) cohort studies of people with tuberculosis before and after anti- tuberculo- sis treatment. Both designs have limitations. Case control studies often do not specify whether or not people start taking anti- tuberculosis drugs [23, 27]. Cohort stud- ies that have been published have suffered from limited sample size and short follow-up time [30, 35]. This group of studies have yielded conflicting conclusions [24, 30] leading to debate in the tuberculosis research and clinical community', 'Page 2 of 12 Zhang et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2025) 25:453 Conclusions Findings from our study show that anti-tuberculosis treatment has profound effects on people with tuberculosis gastrointestinal function and the gut microbiota, particularly during the intensive phase of therapy. After the intensive treatment phase, the gut microbiota has partially recovered, but it is an extremely slow process. Keywords Tuberculosis, Gut Microbiome, Anti-tuberculosis treatment, Dysbiosis, Diversity Introduction Tuberculosis is among the oldest diseases in human his- tory [1]. People with tuberculosis may have symptoms ranging from cough, fever, sweats, and weight loss to poor appetite. It is estimated that one untreated tubercu- losis patient can infect 12–14 healthy people in one single year. In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people worldwide were afflicted with tuberculosis, with 69% concentrated in Southeast Asia (45%) and Africa (23%)', '. No respiratory illnesses were present in any of the controls, and there was no record of any contact with individuals suffering from active TB. No one of the registered participants had been given probiotics, prebiotics, or antibiotics a month before being admitted to the hospital. The initial TB group was those who had never used antituberculosis drugs or were treated with antituberculosis drugs for the ﬁrst time for less than 1 month; The Recurrent TB refers to patients with tuberculosis who have been treated with anti- tuberculosis therapy for more than 1 month or who have failed initial treatment and relapsed. All participants’ basic demographic and clinical data were gathered during the initial hospital assessment. The storage of fresh stool samples took place at a temperature of -80°C.

Results Participants’ socio-demographic and clinical characteristics The longitudinal cohort study involved thirty (30) conﬁrmed TB individuals and twenty-six (26) healthy controls (TB and HIV negative). The TB-infected participants were followed up for over 15 months, including during six months of the treatment and then nine months after the treatment completion. The age, sex, and smoking status of study participants are shown in Table 1. Age was signiﬁcantly different between healthy controls and TB patients, while sex and smoking status were not signiﬁcantly different (Table 1). A total of 19/30 (63.33%) of the TB patients were infected with the modern Euro-American lineage 4, which showed a high amount of persistence of sputum smear positivity at month-2 of TB treatment 10/13 (76.92%)', '. In general, we aim to identify the association with the microbiome, biochemical index and pulmonary tuberculosis. Material and methods Ethics This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Afﬁliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (2022-YX-268), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participant recruitment A total of 69 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 63 healthy controls were initially enrolled from the Afﬁliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China, from May 2021 to June 2022. All patients were recruited on the basis of TB symptomatic features (WS288-2008). Healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in hospital health examination center, who did not have close contact with TB patients at least one year. All participants had not taken any broad-spectrum antibiotics in the previous six months and without other basic diseases or major illness', '. 4 Department of Chronic Communicable Disease, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing, PR China. 5 Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.
