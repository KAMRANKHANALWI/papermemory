crc_microbiome_mcq_008,mcq,medium,factual,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,"The generated answer is incorrect as it states F. nucleatum is associated with late-stage CRC, but the reference answer indicates it starts in stage II. The answer is also not relevant to the question as it does not exclude early-stage CRC. The completeness is 0.0 as the answer does not provide any information about the other options.","Contexts 1 and 2 are partially relevant as they mention oral-typical microbes and CRC, but they do not specifically mention Dialister pneumosintes or its association with late-stage CRC. Context 3 is not relevant as it lists various species but does not provide information about their association with CRC stages."
antibiotic_microbiome_mcq_010,mcq,hard,mechanism,0.9,1.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,"The generated answer is factually correct, but it could be more complete by mentioning the differential effects (neutral, synergistic or antagonistic) of drug combinations on the activity of antibiotics against microorganisms.","Contexts do not mention anything about the critical consideration for developing narrow-spectrum therapies based on drug combinations, making them irrelevant to answering the question."
gut_health_mcq_009,mcq,medium,factual,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.8,0.8,"The generated answer is factually correct and directly addresses the question. It is highly relevant to the question and provides a clear explanation. However, it could be more complete by providing a direct reference to the text or the paper, which would increase its completeness score to 1.0.","Contexts 1 and 2 are highly relevant to the question as they discuss the beneficial functions of gut microbiota, including vitamin synthesis. However, Context 3 is less precise as it only mentions 'essential functions' without specifying what those functions are, but it still contributes to recall as it implies that gut microbiota has beneficial functions. Precision is slightly lower due to the vagueness of Context 3."
crc_biomarkers_mcq_009,mcq,hard,mechanism,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.75,1.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct but lacks the crucial detail that seven ASVs belonging to Alistipes covered all Bacteroides sp.-positive patients, not just the relationship between A. dispar and A. senegalensis. The answer is highly relevant to the question, but its completeness is limited due to the missing information.","Context 1 is highly relevant to the question, directly stating that Alistipes covered all patients who are positive for Bacteroides sp. Context 2 is not relevant to the question, but Context 3 indirectly supports the relevance of the study by mentioning the screening process used in the study. However, Context 1 is sufficient to answer the question, making Context 2 and Context 3 not necessary for recall."
tb_microbiome_mcq_001,mcq,easy,factual,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,"The generated answer is factually correct, directly relevant to the question, and provides complete information about the study period.","Contexts 1 and 2 are partially relevant to the study, but they do not provide information about the study period. Context 3 mentions study visits, but it does not specify the time frame of the study. Therefore, precision is 0.5, as they are related to the study but not directly to the study period. Recall is 0.0, as none of the contexts contain the necessary information to generate the reference answer."
