The context states that compiled data from the MetaHit and Human Microbiome Project identified 2,172 species isolated from human beings.","['. Using MetaPhlAn2 for taxonomic proﬁling, we identiﬁed 11 phyla, 156 genera and 400 species across the three groups (Tables S2, S3, S4). Compared with the number of species present in the controls, the species present in the patients was signiﬁcantly decreased (P = 1.95E-5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1A). Consistently, the Shannon index, indicating within-sample (α) diversity, was much lower for the P groups than that for the controls (P = 2.84E- 4; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1B). NMDS analysis based on genus relative abundance also revealed striking diﬀerences between the C and P groups especially at the NMDS 2 axis (Figure 1C). Gut Bacteria Associated With M. tuberculosis Infection We then compared the relative abundance of each identiﬁed species across the two groups to identify the bacteria in the human gut microbiota that are altered in response to M. tuberculosis infection. We found that 25 species were diﬀerentially enriched in the two groups', '. Next, to take compositionality into account, the relative abundance table was transformed using the center log ratio (CLR) prior to PC analysis. PC analysis was carried out using the prcomp() function in the stats R package (R Core Team, 2022). Inference of taxonomic content of the gut microbiome and between- group comparisons Prior to downstream analyses, all bacterial taxa observed only in a single donor and at a relative abundance of less than 0.0001 were discarded. The choice of an abundance threshold ensured that we kept rare bacterial species that can impact human disease, as demonstrated in recent work (Chriswell et al., 2022). Metaphlan v4.0 tool was used to infer both known bacterial species and strains as well as uncharacterized bacterial species. Uncharacterized bacterial species in the metaphlan v4.0 tool are deﬁned in terms of species-level genome bins (SGBs) using so-called metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) (Blanco-Mı́guez et al., 2023)', '. First, we estimated the abundance of 58 species that were significantlydifferent in abundance between LGC and HGC individuals (Supplementary Table 6). For each individual, we used these values to compute a score, named decisive bacterial abund- ance (DBA) score, equal to the sum of abundances of the species more frequent in HGC individuals subtracted by the sum of the abundances of species more frequent in LGC individuals. The DBA scores were calculated exhaustively for all combinations of up to 19 species and were used in the ROC analysis; the area under curve (AUC) values for the best combinations are shown in Fig. 2b, left. The best combina- tion of four species gave an AUC value of 0.98 (Fig. 2b, right); in a tenfold cross-validation test40 with 90% of randomly chosen individuals the AUC value of 0.9766 0.02 (mean6 s.d.) was obtained for the groups of the remaining 10%, indicating the robustness of the analysis', '. Statistics All statistical analyses were performed using R packages. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to compare diﬀerences in SNP distributions between groups. Spearman’s rank test was performed to analyze the correlation between species. When multiple hypothesis tests were performed simultaneously, P-values were corrected using Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Microbial Diversity is Decreased in TB Patients To characterize alterations in the gut microbiota in TB patients, we analyzed the microbial composition and metabolic potential of the gut microbiota in 61 samples from the C (n = 31) and P (n = 30) groups (Table S1). Using MetaPhlAn2 for taxonomic proﬁling, we identiﬁed 11 phyla, 156 genera and 400 species across the three groups (Tables S2, S3, S4)', '. More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]']"

The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), based on Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac and weighted UniFrac distances were performed to identify the difference in fecal microbiota composition between PTB patients and HCs. As shown in Figure 1D, there was a tendency of separation and had a partial overlap between two groups, which demonstrated that the total community of gut microbiota in the two groups was different. The compositions of the fecal microbiota in the PTB patients and the HCs were assessed at different taxonomic levels, and the top 20 relative abundance of bacteria were shown in Figure 2A. At the phylum level, we observed an enrichment of Bacteroidota (33.10% vs. 27.08%), Proteobacteria(12.99% vs. 9.83%) and Fusobacteriota(0.58% vs. 0.56%, P<0.05), and a remarkable decrease of Firmicutes(48.07% vs. 55.89%, P<0.05) and Actinobacteriota(2.44% vs. 5.83%, P<0.01) in PTB patients compared with HCs (Figure 2B)', 'Del Chierico et al. Gut Microbiota Age-Dependent Patterns in Obesity and Verrucomicrobia). Applying the Kruskal–Wallis test on the relative abundances of phyla for the four groups, we observed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distributions of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes (p < 0.05). However, a false discovery rate (FDR) correction of p-values deﬁned Actinobacteria as the only signiﬁcant taxon diﬀerentially describing the four groups (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Particularly, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were statistically signiﬁcant for the ob_ado/ob_adult couple, with Actinobacteria levels being higher in the ob_ado group, and Bacteroidetes levels being uppermost in the ob_adult group. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were statistically signiﬁcant for adolescent obese versus CTRL (Supplementary Table S2)', '. 1c, Table S2). At the genus level, the variation trend of dominant bacterial genera (an abundance > 0.1% in the two groups) is shown in Table S3. Among the dominant microbiota, the abundance of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Feacalibacterium was higher, and the abundance of Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Eubacterium_ hallii_group were lowered in the TB group vs. HC group (Fig. 1d). To better understand the difference in micro\xad biota between the two groups, we further performed a LEfSe analysis according to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score ≥ 4.0. The results of LEfSe analysis showed that 11 key genera were different between the two groups (Fig. 1e). The cladogram Figure (from phylum to genus level) shows that altered genera mainly belonged to Bac\xad teroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Fig. 1f). Over\xad all, our data indicate that the gut bacterial diversity and composition have been altered in TB patients', '. Our results suggest that untreated TB patients arrive at the hospital with a strongly disturbed gut community. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between TB patients and healthy controls We characterized microbiomes at different taxonomic resolutions to facilitate comparison with published data. At the phylum level, TB patients showed an apparent increase in Firmicutes abundance (36.4% vs. 21.3% in controls, p = 0.03) and an elevated proportion of Actinobacteria (1.8% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.0002) and Proteobacteria (5.6% vs. 3.8%, p > 0.05) (Figure 2A). This increase in Firmicutes was at the expense of Bacteroidetes (54% vs. 72.2%), a frequent sign of a disturbed gut microbiome. Taxonomic composition at the genus, family, and order levels was also strongly altered in TB patients (Supplementary Figure 2). We next used LEfSe, a linear discriminant analysis, to identify the combination of microbial species that differentiate TB patients’ gut microbiomes from HCs (Segata et al., 2011)', '. In general, the major bacteria present in oral microbiota are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacter- oidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Although healthy human lungs were long considered sterile, numerous studies have demonstrated that microbiota is also present in lung tissues.11 The core lung microbiota included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The composition of lung microbiota is primarily determined by three factors: 1) microbial immigration, 2) the elimination of micro- organisms, and 3) the reproduction rates of microorganisms.12 In human skin, the distribution and variety of glands and hair follicles vary among each geographic region. The physical and chemical differences of skin regions create distinct composition of microbiota.13 Generally, the skin microbiota is composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria']"

Explanation: The context explicitly states that *Akkermansia muciniphila* is the only known representative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla isolated from humans.","['. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]', '. The most highly represented phyla in the gastric mucosa under normal conditions are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (recently renamed to Bacillota36), Bacteroidetes (recently renamed to Bacteroidota36), Actinobacteria, and Fusobacte- ria.37−39 The gastric juice has a diverse microbial community that differs from the gastric mucosa. The dominating phyla in gastric juice are Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gastric mucosa.37,40,41 Furthermore, bacteria found in the oral cavity and duodenum such as Veillonella, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium can transiently colonize the stomach.40,42 Unsurprisingly, H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019). The ﬁrst step in identifying the symbiotic interactions between intestinal microbes and their hosts is to describe the balanced composition of gut microbiota and disease-related variations. The microbes reside in a mutual association with the host in a healthy state, aﬀecting the host’s health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells to promote host physiology and immunity (Ribaldone et al., 2022). An initial underestimation of the total number of microbial species in the intestine has been described through several vivo and ex vivo studies due to complications in culturing certain microorganisms (Lagier et al., 2015)']"

The context states that the three predominant SCFAs—propionate, butyrate, and acetate—are typically found in a proportion of 1:1:3 in the GI tract.","['. Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]. Butyrate is produced from carbohydrates via glycolysis and acetoacetyl-CoA, whereas two pathways, the succinate or propanediol pathway, are known for the formation of propionate, depending on the nature of the sugar [102]. In the human gut, propionate is mainly produced by Bacteroidetes, whereas the production of butyrate is dominated by Firmicutes [102,139,140]. For example, fermentation of starch by specialist Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, e.g. Eubacterium rectale or E. hallii, is thought to contribute signiﬁcantly to butyrate production in the colon both directly and via metabolic cross-feeding [102]. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]', '. In add- ition, the interaction between commensal microbiota and the mucosal immune system is crucial for proper immune function. Colonic bacteria express carbohydrate-active enzymes, which endow them with the ability to ferment complex carbohydrates generating metabolites such as SCFAs [136]. Three predominant SCFAs, propionate, butyrate and acetate, are typically found in a proportion of 1:1:3 in the GI tract [137]. These SCFAs are rapidly absorbed by epithelial cells in the GI tract where they are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene expression, chemotaxis, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis [138]. Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]', '.
