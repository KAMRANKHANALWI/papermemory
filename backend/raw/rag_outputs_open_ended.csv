gut_intro_001,What are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota?,Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota,easy,factual,"Based on the provided context, the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota are **Firmicutes** and **Bacteroidetes** (also referred to as **Bacteroides**). These two phyla make up 90% of the gut microbiota.","['. More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]', '. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. The most highly represented phyla in the gastric mucosa under normal conditions are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (recently renamed to Bacillota36), Bacteroidetes (recently renamed to Bacteroidota36), Actinobacteria, and Fusobacte- ria.37−39 The gastric juice has a diverse microbial community that differs from the gastric mucosa. The dominating phyla in gastric juice are Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gastric mucosa.37,40,41 Furthermore, bacteria found in the oral cavity and duodenum such as Veillonella, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium can transiently colonize the stomach.40,42 Unsurprisingly, H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H', '. 3.1.1. Increasing the Abundance of Specific Members of the Microbiome. A low microbial diversity of the human microbiome is significantly associated with several diseases.206 However, the changes observed in the microbiome composition might be dissimilar in different populations. For example, Dutch and Belgian cohorts showed a negative correlation between the Bacteroidetes enrichment and diversity,207 whereas a positive correlation was observed between Bacteroidetes and diversity in African individuals,208 underscoring the need for population- specific comparisons of the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients. The ratio of the two most dominant phyla in the microbiome, namely, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, is one of the most important parameters representing microbiome diversity, at least in the gut', '. Eubiosis conditions are eﬀective in controlling various diseases caused by microbes. Proper intake of a healthy diet and the development of eubiosis acts in favor of human health. The high intake of antibiotics causes an imbalance in the gut microbiota and favors systemic diseases (Santacroce et al., 2021). Several population-based studies have revealed the highly beneﬁcial role of human gut microbiota in healthy people, as well as the importance of well-understanding its structure and the factors that inﬂuence its composition, such as food, age, geography, systemic disorders, and drugs (Wang et al., 2017; Rowland et al., 2018). Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019)']"

Introduction The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents one of the largest interfaces (250–400 m2) between the host, environmental factors and antigens in the human body. In an average life time, around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract, along with an abundance of microorganisms from the environment which impose a huge threat on gut integrity [1]. The collection of bacteria, archaea and eukarya colonising the GI tract is termed the ‘gut microbiota’ and has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years to form an intricate and mutually beneﬁcial relationship [2,3]. The number of microorganisms inhabiting the GI tract has been estimated to exceed 1014, which encom- passes ∼10 times more bacterial cells than the number of human cells and over 100 times the amount of genomic content (microbiome) as the human genome [2,4].

Many studies worldwide have focused on the signiﬁcant impact of intestinal microbiota on human health and disease (AboNahas et al., 2022). The human body is colonized by a diversity of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. Microbes inhabit all human body surfaces, but a signiﬁcant number of microbes live in the gastrointestinal tract/gut. The human gut possesses approximately more than one thousand microbial species that form a complex ecological community called gut microbiota (Lagier et al., 2016).

gut_intro_003,How does mode of delivery affect infant gut microbiota composition?,"Vaginally delivered infants have microbiota containing high abundance of lactobacilli, while C-section delivered infants are depleted in Bacteroides and colonized by Clostridium species instead",medium,mechanism,"Based on the provided context, the mode of delivery affects infant gut microbiota composition in the following ways:

*   **Source of Inoculation:** Naturally delivered (vaginal) infants are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota. In contrast, infants born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to skin microbiota and the microbiome found in the environment.
*   **Microbial Diversity and Abundance:** 
    *   **Vaginal Delivery:** These infants show a high abundance of *lactobacilli* during the first few days. At three days old, they possess a greater abundance and variety of *Bifidobacterium* spp.
    *   **C-section Delivery:** These infants experience depleted and delayed colonization of the *Bacteroides* genus. They are instead colonized by facultative anaerobes such as *Clostridium* species.
*   **Resemblance to Mother:** The fecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles their mother’s fecal microbiota, whereas this resemblance is reduced to 41% in babies delivered by C-section.
*   **Long-term Development:** While the mode of delivery influences the initial dominating groups of the gut microbiome, by the age of 3, the gut microbiome changes to resemble that of an adult.","['.

The human microbiome is generally stable and resistant once the microorganism has adapted to the environ- ment. On top of intrinsic factors that may cause a shift in the microbiome over time, extrinsic factors such as diet, lifestyle, medication, geographic location, climate, and seasonality may cause changes to the microbial community. Moreover, the mode of delivery during birth has been shown to influence the microbiome. For example, newborns delivered via the vaginal versus Caesarean delivery possess different groups of dominat- ing gut microbiome. However, at the age of 3, the gut microbiome changes to resemble that of the adult’s gut microbiome.7 As people reach beyond the age of 70, the ability to digest food and absorb nutrients in the gut changes, affecting the composition of the gut microbiome', '. After birth, the GI tract is rapidly colonised, with life events such as illness, antibiotic treatment and changes in diet causing chaotic shifts in the microbiota [24,25]. The mode of delivery also appears to affect the microbiota composition, with vaginally delivered infants’ microbiota containing a high abundance of lactobacilli during the ﬁrst few days, a reﬂection of the high load of lactobacilli in the vaginal ﬂora [26,27]. In contrast, the micro- biota of infants delivered by C-section is depleted and delayed in the colonisation of the Bacteroides genus, but colonised by facultative anaerobes such as Clostridium species [28,29]. Whilst the faecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles that of their mothers’ faecal microbiota, in babies delivered by C-section, this percentage is reduced to only 41% [30]. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]', '. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age. Facultative anaerobes are the first to colonize the gut at birth, and these bacteria create anaerobic conditions that promote the growth of obligate anaerobes, starting with Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp., within 2 weeks.47 Infants born naturally are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas those born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to the skin microbiota as well as the microbiome found in the environ- ment.48 At 3 days, infants who were naturally delivered possessed a greater abundance and variety of Bifidobacterium spp', '. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.

gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis",hard,mechanism,"Based on the provided context, butyrate plays several key roles in intestinal health:

*   **Energy Source:** It is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes.
*   **Maintenance of Anaerobic Conditions:** Butyrate helps maintain the anaerobic environment of the colon by activating $\beta$-oxidation in the mitochondria and activating the nuclear receptor PPAR$\gamma$ in colonic cells. This limits the diffusion of oxygen into the luminal part of the gut, which prevents the overgrowth of facultative anaerobes (such as Enterobacteriaceae) that can increase the risk of intestinal inflammation.
*   **Anti-inflammatory Effects:** It stimulates regulatory T cells (Treg) to reduce inflammation. By binding to PPAR$\gamma$, it also represses inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which decreases the production of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrates, thereby limiting the availability of nitrates for specific pathogens.
*   **Anti-carcinogenic Properties:** Butyrate acts as a tumor-suppressive metabolite and anti-carcinogen. It exhibits differential effects on normal versus cancerous cells; in colon cancer cells, it is metabolized less, allowing it to accumulate and act as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. This inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell apoptosis (cell death). 
*   **Gene Expression:** It regulates gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase.

Note: While generally tumor-suppressive, one study mentioned in the text suggests that in individuals with specific genetic variations, butyrate could potentially function as an oncometabolite and promote tumor progression.","['. However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells. Indeed, the abundance of oxygen in the luminal part of the gut and its gradually decreasing concentration towards the epithe- lium is a key requirement for anaerobic bacteria to remain in the close vicinity of the epithelium as opposed to facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) that have been shown to increase the risk of intestinal inflam- mation (figure 3).80 81 Butyrate contributes to control of the anaerobic condition in the colon by activating the β-oxidation in the mitochondria. By activating the nuclear receptor peroxi- some proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the colonic cells, butyrate limits the diffusion of oxygen from the colonocytes to the luminal part, thereby maintaining the anaer- obic conditions', '. Belcheva et al. suggested that supplementation with prebiotic/butyrate could promote tumor progression due to genetic variation in individuals.345 Their ﬁndings suggest that butyrate functions as an oncometabolite, while a substantial of studies reported butyrate as tumor suppressive metabolite. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes', '. Butyrate also binds to peroxisome proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which in turn repress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), decreases nitric oxide production (NO) and eventually nitrate production. Conversely, in pathological situations low butyrate content in the lumen is associated with lower PPARγ activity, increased glycolysis and lower oxygen consumption. This is associated with a higher expression of iNOS which in turn produces more NO and eventually increases nitrates availability for specific pathogens. Butyrate can also stimulate immune cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg) to reduce inflammation. The nuclear transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is highly expressed and activated in healthy colonocytes, whereas agonists of AhR are lower or reduced AhR activity can lead to altered gut barrier function', '. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes. In colon cancer cells, butyrate is metabolized to a lesser extent compared to normal cells, thereby accumulating as HDAC inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis.346 The difference observed in this study may lay between host genetic back- ground, the age, and the presence of other bacterial 853 North America 69 South America 1332 Europe 662 Asia 56 Africa 13 Pacifica 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Allergy Cancer Diabetes Related C.Difficile Infection Heart Disease HIV Inflammatory Bowel Disorders Liver Cirrhosis Mental Disease Neural Disease Obesity Other Bowel Disorders Other Infections Other Inflammatory Disease Early Phase 1 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Clinical trials related to microbiota a b c d Cancer Response No response Response No response Response No response C.Difficile Infection Inflammatory Bowel Disorders 331 210 315 124 92 25 Fig', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 FIGURE 2 Positive health outcomes of gut microbial eubiosis. hydrogen, and carbon dioxide; these products are further used by the host or excreted (Patrascu et al., 2017).

These are the main SCFAs that perform several essential functions in the human body (Rauf et al., 2022). Butyrate is perhaps the essential SCFA for human health, as it is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes (Wang et al., 2019).
