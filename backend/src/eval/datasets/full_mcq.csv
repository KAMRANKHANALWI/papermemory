Based on this, the Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA) approach was selected as the optimal imputation technique",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_mcq_009,Which combination of genera showed significant enrichment specifically in the UC pediatric group?,Bacteroides and Prevotella,Enterococcus and Lactobacillus,Faecalibacterium and Roseburia,Escherichia and Klebsiella,B,"Significant enrichment of Enterococcus and Lactobacillus representatives was observed in the UC group. The study notes that Enterococcus and Lactobacillus increased possibly as a result of taking a probiotic, distinguishing the UC phenotype from CD",hard,factual
ibd_metabolomics_mcq_010,What was the key mechanistic finding regarding Akkermansia in IBD patients?,"Akkermansia increased in both UC and CD, promoting inflammation",Akkermansia showed no significant change across any IBD subtype,Akkermansia significantly decreased in both UC and CD patients; it has ability to restrain autoimmune reactions and reduce proinflammatory cytokines,Akkermansia increased only in CD but decreased in UC,C,"An important feature identified was a significant decrease in representatives of the genus Akkermansia in patients with both UC and CD. It is known that Akkermansia spp. have the ability to restrain autoimmune reactions and reduce proinflammatory cytokines, making its depletion significant for IBD pathogenesis",hard,mechanism
