gut_intro_002,What is the ratio of human to bacterial cells in the body according to recent estimates?,"Recent estimates suggest that the ratio of human to bacterial cells is closer to 1:1, revising the earlier estimate of 1:10",easy,factual
gut_intro_003,How does mode of delivery affect infant gut microbiota composition?,"Vaginally delivered infants have microbiota containing high abundance of lactobacilli, while C-section delivered infants are depleted in Bacteroides and colonized by Clostridium species instead",medium,mechanism
gut_intro_004,What are short-chain fatty acids and which are the three predominant types found in the GI tract?,"Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites produced by colonic bacteria through fermentation of complex carbohydrates. The three predominant types are acetate, propionate, and butyrate, typically found in a 3:1:1 ratio",medium,factual
gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis",hard,mechanism
gut_intro_006,What is dysbiosis and how is it related to disease?,Dysbiosis is an altered gut bacterial composition that differs from the normal microbiota. It has been associated with the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases and infections,easy,definition
gut_intro_007,How does dietary fiber deficiency affect the gut microbiota and mucosal barrier?,"Dietary fiber deficiency causes the gut microbiota to switch to utilizing secreted mucins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the colonic mucus barrier, thinner mucus in the distal colon, increased microbial proximity to the epithelium, and enhanced pathogen susceptibility",hard,mechanism
gut_intro_008,What role does Akkermansia muciniphila play in metabolic health?,"Akkermansia muciniphila prevents development of high-fat diet-induced obesity, ameliorates metabolic endotoxemia-induced inflammation, restores gut barrier function by increasing mucin secretion and intestinal tight-junction proteins, and reduces body weight gain and fat mass",medium,mechanism
gut_intro_009,Compare the microbiota composition between the small intestine and the colon,"The small intestine has high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials with short transit time, limiting bacterial growth to rapidly growing facultative anaerobes dominated by Lactobacillaceae. The colon supports a dense diverse community mainly of anaerobes dominated by Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae that can utilize complex carbohydrates",hard,comparison
gut_intro_010,At what age does the infant gut microbiota resemble adult microbiota?,"By around 2.5 years of age, the composition, diversity and functional capabilities of the infant microbiota resemble those of adult microbiota",easy,factual
gut_intro_011,How do antibiotics affect the gut microbiota in terms of pathogen colonization?,"Antibiotics dramatically disrupt microbial balance and alter the nutritional landscape of the gut, leading to increased mucosal carbohydrate availability including fucose and sialic acid liberated by the microbiota. This favors expansion of pathogens like Salmonella Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile",hard,mechanism
gut_intro_012,What is the role of secretory IgA in the gut?,"Secretory IgA co-localizes with gut bacteria in the outer mucus layer, limits exposure of epithelial cell surface to bacteria, mediates bacterial biofilm formation via binding to bacterial SIgA receptors, and is anchored in the outer colonic mucus layer providing immune protection against pathogens while maintaining mutually beneficial relationships with commensals",medium,mechanism
gut_intro_013,Explain the concept of microbial cross-feeding in the gut,"Microbial cross-feeding occurs when fermentation products from one bacterium serve as substrates for others. For example, acetate produced by Ruminococcus bromii or lactate from lactic acid bacteria is converted to butyrate by Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae. This cooperation allows colonization by more diverse organisms and shapes the microbiota community",hard,mechanism
gut_intro_014,What are the main benefits the gut microbiota provides to the host?,"The gut microbiota strengthens gut integrity, shapes the intestinal epithelium, harvests energy through SCFA production, protects against pathogens through colonization resistance and antimicrobial production, regulates host immunity, synthesizes essential vitamins, and metabolizes bile acids",medium,factual
gut_intro_015,How does FUT2 genotype affect gut microbiota composition?,"FUT2 genotype determines the presence (secretor) or absence (non-secretor) of H and ABO antigens in GI mucosa through expression of an α1,2-fucosyltransferase. This affects mucin O-glycosylation patterns and influences the abundance of many bacterial groups in the gut microbiota",hard,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_001,How many metagenomic and metabolomic cohorts were analyzed in this multi-omics IBD study?,The study comprehensively analyzed 9 metagenomic cohorts (N = 1363 cases) and 4 metabolomics cohorts (N = 398 cases) of IBD patients from different countries or regions through cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA),easy,factual
multiomics_ibd_002,What are the three rarely reported bacteria identified in IBD through cross-cohort analysis?,"Three bacteria rarely reported in IBD were identified: Asaccharobacter celatus, Gemmiger formicilis, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum. These bacteria showed consistent alterations across multiple cohorts",easy,factual
multiomics_ibd_003,What bioinformatics tools were used for taxonomic and functional profiling of metagenomic data?,"MetaPhlan3 tool was used for taxonomic profiling, which utilizes a library of clade-specific markers to provide pan-microbial profiling. HUMAnN3 was used for functional profiling, which constructs a sample-specific reference database from the pangenomes of species detected by MetaPhlAn3",easy,factual
multiomics_ibd_004,How many differential metabolites were identified with significant differences in IBD?,"Metabolomics analysis identified 36 metabolites with significant differences between IBD patients and healthy controls. Additionally, 78 total metabolites showed differential abundance, with most enriched in IBD patients belonging to three major nutrient metabolism categories: amino acids, carbohydrates, and fatty acids",easy,factual
multiomics_ibd_005,What were the AUROC values achieved for IBD diagnosis using multi-omics biomarkers?,"The study identified multi-omics biomarkers for IBD diagnosis that were validated across multiple global cohorts with AUROC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98. In the Renji cohort, 10-fold cross-validation achieved an AUROC of 0.98, while independent validation reached 0.96",easy,factual
multiomics_ibd_006,Explain the multi-omics biological correlation (MOBC) maps framework and its significance in IBD research,"The MOBC maps framework was constructed to elucidate relationships between gut microbiota and metabolites using fecal metagenomic and metabolomic data from four cohorts (n = 391). This framework highlights gut microbial biotransformation deficiencies and significant alterations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The analysis identified 8 differential KO genes with associations to both metabolism and disease phenotypes, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of IBD by linking metabolites to genes encoding potential enzymes directly involved in their metabolic processes",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_007,How did alpha and beta diversity differ between IBD patients and healthy controls?,"IBD patients exhibited significantly lower microbial alpha diversity compared to healthy controls (FDR < 0.0001) as measured by Shannon and Simpson indices. Beta diversity, calculated using Bray-Curtis distance, showed significant differences based on both disease status (PERMANOVA P = 0.001) and cohorts (PERMANOVA P = 0.001). This reduced microbial diversity in IBD patients may disrupt the gut ecosystem balance and contribute to disease development",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_008,Describe the role of butyric acid-producing bacteria in IBD according to the study findings,"The study found a significant reduction in commensal gut microbiota that produce butyric acid in IBD patients. Several butyric acid-producing species were depleted, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium hallii, Gemmiger formicilis, Eubacterium rectale, and Ruminococcus bromii. These bacteria are crucial for various host activities, and their depletion represents a consistent pattern across different IBD cohorts despite significant differences in diet and genetics among patients from various regions",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_009,What is the significance of the Two-component system pathway in IBD pathogenesis?,"Metagenomic functional analysis revealed that essential genes of the Two-component system pathway, linked to fecal calprotectin, are implicated in IBD. Among the 8 KO genes enriched in this pathway, crp (K10914, CRP/FNR family transcriptional regulator) showed the highest generalized fold change. This gene is involved in osmoregulation, stringent response, and biofilm formation. The relative abundance of crp is positively correlated with fecal calprotectin, suggesting it acts as a critical transcriptional regulatory factor contributing to gut inflammation. Two-component systems play a critical role in regulating virulence factors in certain bacteria",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_010,How does Asaccharobacter celatus potentially relate to autoimmune disease regulation?,"Asaccharobacter celatus, identified as depleted across six distinct IBD cohorts, possesses the ability to produce Equol, which has the potential to alleviate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice. This implies a potential role for Asaccharobacter celatus in the regulation of autoimmune diseases. However, previous studies have not extensively investigated the relationship between this bacterium and IBD",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_011,What metabolic alterations related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle were observed in IBD patients?,"The study observed that various organic acids related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enriched in IBD patients, including Pyruvic acid, Fumaric acid, Malonic acid, and Oxoglutaric acid. This enrichment indicates abnormal energy metabolism of intestinal microbiota in IBD. Additionally, amino acids such as Tryptophan, Glutamine, Arginine, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, and Histidine were found to be enriched in the intestines of IBD patients",medium,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_012,Compare the diagnostic performance of bacterial species models versus KO gene models for IBD detection,"Through CCIA with FDR < 0.0001, 74 microbial species were identified, from which 31 feature species were selected using IFE for Random Forest modeling. These species-level models showed strong ability to detect IBD with AUROC ranging from 0.66 to 0.95 across cohorts. For KO genes, 162 differentially expressed genes were identified (FDR < 1×10⁻¹²), with 25 selected as features. All cohorts except HeQ 2017 (AUROC: 0.98) showed decreased AUROC values compared to bacterial species models. Cohort-to-cohort transfer analysis for KO genes showed mean AUROC values ranging from 0.74 to 0.81. While KO gene models showed somewhat lower diagnostic performance than bacterial species models, their diagnostic sensitivity was still acceptable",hard,comparison
multiomics_ibd_013,Explain how the K22477 gene deficiency contributes to IBD symptoms through glutamate metabolism,"K22477 (argO, N-acetylglutamate synthase) is responsible for producing N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-CoA. The study revealed that IBD patients have reduced levels of K22477, leading to an excess of L-glutamate. This overabundance of L-glutamate can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in IBD patients. This finding highlights how impaired gut microbial biotransformation, resulting from substantial reduction in the gut commensal community, contributes to disease pathology",hard,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_014,Describe the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in IBD and their potential as therapeutic targets,"The study identified four genes encoding aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis enzymes within the symbiotic bacterial community: K09759 (aspS, nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), K01870 (ileS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase), K01892 (hisS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase), and K01873 (valS, valyl-tRNA synthetase). This was consistent with KEGG Orthology Enrichment Analysis showing significant increase in aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway. While aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are indispensable for protein synthesis, recent studies indicate their biological functions extend beyond translation. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila secretes seryl-tRNA synthetase (AmTARS), which modulates immune homeostasis and facilitates production of anti-inflammatory IL-10. These findings suggest ARSs from gut microbiota may influence host immune response and regulate gut homeostasis, representing a valuable and underutilized resource for therapeutic targets in IBD",hard,mechanism
multiomics_ibd_015,How does integration of multi-omics data improve IBD diagnostic performance compared to single-omics approaches?,"The study systematically evaluated combining different omics panels (31 species, 25 KO genes, 13 metabolites). When species and KO genes were combined, diagnostic performance showed AUROC > 0.97 in Renji cohort and > 0.9 in USA-NL cohort. Combining species and metabolites showed the best performance among paired combinations, generally achieving AUROC > 0.9. The integration of all three panels (species, KO genes, and metabolites) significantly enhanced diagnostic performance: In Renji cohort, 10-fold cross-validation achieved AUROC of 0.98 with independent validation reaching 0.96; in USA-NL cohorts, 10-fold cross-validation reached 0.93 with independent validation at 0.92. This represents a significant improvement over previous non-invasive diagnostic models and demonstrates that combining diverse omics data substantially enhances machine learning model performance for IBD diagnosis",hard,comparison
ibd_microbiota_001,What percentage of the global population is affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?,"Inflammatory bowel disease affects an estimated 0.3–0.5% of the global population. IBD is broadly divided into Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), which involve inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract or the colon, respectively.",easy,factual
ibd_microbiota_002,What are the two main bacterial phyla that constitute the majority of gut microbiota?,"The most dominant bacterial groups in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which together constitute approximately 90% of gut microbiota. These phyla are key producers of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).",easy,factual
ibd_microbiota_003,Name three beneficial bacterial species that are reduced in patients with IBD,"Beneficial bacteria reduced in active IBD include Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia hominis, and Eubacterium rectale. F. prausnitzii is one of the most abundant species in the human gut and is a key producer of butyrate, a SCFA with anti-inflammatory properties.",easy,factual
ibd_microbiota_004,Which fungal species has been found to produce the toxin candidalysin in IBD patients?,Candida albicans produces the toxin candidalysin in a strain-dependent manner. Highly damaging C. albicans strains producing candidalysin have been identified in the gut of individuals with ulcerative colitis. Candidalysin induces intestinal inflammation by damaging epithelial membranes and activating the MAPK pathway.,easy,factual
ibd_microbiota_005,What is the role of TRPV1 nociceptors in intestinal health according to the paper?,"TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) nociceptors play a protective role in the gut by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair. Disruption of nociceptors through chemogenetic and adenoviral-mediated silencing or pharmacological TRPV1 nociceptor ablation resulted in increased inflammatory cell infiltration and defective tissue repair machinery. TRPV1 nociceptors also alter intestinal microbiota composition.",easy,factual
ibd_microbiota_006,Explain how short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contribute to intestinal homeostasis and Treg cell differentiation,"SCFAs such as acetate, propionate and butyrate are synthesized via gut microbial fermentation of dietary fibers and are pivotal in sustaining intestinal homeostasis. Propionic and butyric acids contribute to colonic and peripheral Treg cell differentiation through activation of the GPR43 fatty acid receptor. Butyrate contributes to Treg cell differentiation via an extrathymic pathway dependent on CNS1, an intronic enhancer. SCFAs also act through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition to induce Treg cells, which play a role in limiting inflammatory responses in the intestine.",medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_007,Describe the mechanism by which 3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA) and isoalloLCA modulate intestinal inflammation,"3-oxolithocholic acid (3-oxoLCA), derived from lithocholic acid, inhibits intestinal TH17 cell differentiation via binding to RORγ. IsoalloLCA enhances Treg cell differentiation by binding to nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1) and increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels. Treg cells induced by isoalloLCA suppress inflammation in colitis models. In individuals with Crohn's disease, levels of 3-oxoLCA and isoLCA were decreased, and upregulated genes associated with TH17 cells and IL-17 in IBD patients were found to have negative correlation with these secondary bile acids.",medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_008,How does adherent-invasive Escherichia coli contribute to intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease?,"Adherent-invasive E. coli, which is enriched in individuals with Crohn's disease, promotes intestinal inflammation through propanediol dehydratase-dependent production of propionate and modulation of IL-1β-producing CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes. During IBD, the loss of intestinal hypoxia allows E. coli, a facultative anaerobe, to use reactive oxygen and nitrogen by-products for anaerobic respiration to grow and outcompete gut commensals.",medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_009,What role does the CARD9 gene variant play in fungal immunity and IBD susceptibility?,CARD9 is a critical mediator of systemic antifungal IgG antibody responses to C. albicans and plays a role in CARD9-dependent tuning of the human antibody repertoire. A certain risk variant (S12N; rs4077515) of CARD9 fosters greater TNF and IL-6 production by dendritic cells upon stimulation with depleted zymosan or whole yeast cells. The protective variant (S12NΔ11; rs141992399) leads to attenuated pro-inflammatory signalling through impaired interaction with the ubiquitin ligase TRIM62 upon stimulation with fungal cell wall ligands. Loss-of-function mutation in CX3CR1 in individuals with CD was associated with impaired antifungal antibody responses.,medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_010,Explain the dual role of microbiota-reactive B cells in IBD pathogenesis,"Microbiota-reactive B cells play a dual role in IBD. On the pathogenic side, perturbations of the B cell compartment with expansion of bacteria-reactive IgG+ plasma cells have been described in IBD, and B cell-associated pathology in CD involves cytotoxic T cells with specificity to gut fungal antigens, which are enriched in individuals with anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies. On the protective side, B cells produce secretory IgA, the most abundant immunoglobulin in the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents direct contact between luminal factors (including bacteria) and intestinal epithelial cells. Secretory IgA can also target fungi with high affinity for fungal hyphae, and gut fungi such as C. albicans induce IgA class switch recombination or activate antibody production systemically.",medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_011,Describe how autophagy proteins and ATG16L1 variants affect Paneth cell function and intestinal inflammation,"Defects in autophagy and loss-of-function mutations in autophagy genes are well-documented drivers of IBD. Polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes such as ATG16L1 are strongly associated with both UC and CD. Autophagy proteins prevent intestinal inflammation by supporting Paneth cell homeostasis and viability, controlling endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, and secreting antimicrobial proteins to reinforce intestinal epithelial barrier function. Individuals with variants in ATG16L1 and NOD2 show defective Treg cell responses to outer membrane vesicles delivered by Bacteroides fragilis. Mice with Atg16l1 variants associated with increased CD risk exhibit structural abnormalities in Paneth cells following murine norovirus infection. Apoptosis inhibitor 5 produced by γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes protects Paneth cells from death during intestinal inflammation in both mice and humans carrying the ATG16L1 IBD risk allele.",medium,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_012,Compare the efficacy and mechanisms of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,"FMT has shown modest effects in ulcerative colitis but limited data exists for Crohn's disease. In UC, randomized controlled trials demonstrated remission rates of 24–53%, with four out of five trials showing statistically significant benefit. Roseburia inulinivorans and Eubacterium hallii enrichment, along with increased faecal SCFAs, was associated with remission, whereas increases in Escherichia spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Candida spp. were associated with lack of response. Increased Candida spp. abundance pre-FMT was associated with clinical response, while decreased Candida spp. abundance post-FMT indicated ameliorated disease severity. Both donor material and recipient-specific factors including engraftment play a part in response, with variation in efficacy between different donors (10% vs 39% response rates). There is a paucity of FMT data in CD, indicating it may be less effective or more challenging in this disease subtype.",hard,comparison
ibd_microbiota_013,Explain the concept of indolimines as genotoxic metabolites and their potential role in IBD pathogenesis,"Indolimines are a new class of genotoxic metabolites derived from tryptophan that can induce DNA damage. The presence of a microbiota-encoded decarboxylase gene (aspartate aminotransferase) facilitates the biosynthesis of this class of metabolite. Colonization by indolimine-producing gut bacteria such as Morganella morganii increased intestinal permeability, a phenotype frequently correlated with exacerbated colon inflammation in IBD. Other bacterial species including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum also produced small molecules that induced DNA damage in cell-free assays and expression of the double-strand break marker γ-H2AX in epithelial cells. This DNA damage was caused by a mechanism independent of colibactin-mediated DNA damage driven by selected E. coli strains, indicating the presence of multiple bacteria-associated genotoxic metabolites that could potentially contribute to IBD pathogenesis through chronic epithelial damage.",hard,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_014,Describe the neuroimmune mechanisms linking gut microbiota to pain perception and inflammation in IBD,"The gut microbiota modulates neuroimmune mechanisms affecting pain and inflammation through multiple pathways. Pain is a common symptom in IBD, and the overabundance of enteric-associated neurons (EANs) in inflamed bowel regions correlates with colitis severity. The microbiota can modulate gut-extrinsic EANs - depletion of gut microbiome resulted in increased cFos expression (a neuronal activity marker), indicating increased sympathetic activity. Specific bacterial species and their metabolites (SCFAs, bile acids, GLP-1, peptide YY) modulate sympathetic activity and activate brainstem sensory nuclei. TRPV1 nociceptors play a protective role by regulating intestinal tissue damage, inflammation and repair via release of neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, which also regulate microbiota composition. Microbial metabolites can regulate activation of brainstem sensory nuclei with polysynaptic connections to the intestine, establishing a gut-brain-gut axis. Additionally, the presence of microbial communities induces AHR expression in EANs, which activates genes regulating neuronal excitability and results in increased intestinal peristaltic activity.",hard,mechanism
ibd_microbiota_015,"How do amino acid-conjugated bile acids differ from traditional bile acids, and what is their significance in Crohn's disease?","New bile acid conjugations with amino acids (phenylalanocholic acid, tyrosocholic acid and leucocholic acid) have been identified through metabolome analysis. These bile acid conjugates were enriched in patients with IBD, particularly in a dysbiotic state from patients with Crohn's disease but not UC. There was a strong positive correlation between the presence of Clostridium bolteae and conjugated bile acids, with certain C. bolteae strains able to synthesize phenylalanocholic acid. In a cell-based system, bile acid conjugates stimulated the FXR receptor and expression of its target genes. Several additional amino acid-conjugated bile acids have been discovered using reverse metabolomics approaches and are increased in patients with CD, produced by bacteria belonging to Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Enterococcus genera. These novel conjugates represent a distinct mechanism of bile acid modification that may contribute specifically to CD pathogenesis.",hard,comparison
saudi_ibd_001,How many IBD patients and healthy controls were included in the Saudi Arabian gut microbiota study?,"The study analyzed stool 16S rRNA composition from 219 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 124 healthy controls. Of the IBD patients, there were 135 individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and 84 individuals with ulcerative colitis (UC).",easy,factual
saudi_ibd_002,What sequencing technology and panel were used in this study?,"The study utilized a sequencing strategy that targets all variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene using the Swift Amplicon 16S rRNA Panel on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The assay utilizes a pool of five overlapping primer pairs for a total targeted area spanning V1-V9, and sequencing was performed using 250 bp paired-end reads.",easy,factual
saudi_ibd_003,Which two genera showed significant association with Crohn's disease versus controls in the Saudi population?,"At the genus level, two genera in particular, Veillonella and Lachnoclostridium showed significant association with CD versus controls. Veillonella is an anaerobic bacteria genus commonly associated with gut inflammation, while Lachnoclostridium was significantly upregulated in the CD population.",easy,factual
saudi_ibd_004,What were the top differential genera between CD and UC patients?,"There were significant differences between subjects with CD versus UC, with the top differential genera spanning Akkermansia, Harryflintia, Maegamonas and Phascolarctobacterium. The study showed that there is significant differential Akkermansia abundance in CD versus UC.",easy,factual
saudi_ibd_005,What were the mean ages of IBD cases and controls in the study?,The mean age in the IBD cases was 34.0 years (±SD=11.7) and in controls was 46.8 years (±SD=9.9). The difference in age between groups was statistically significant (p<2.2e-16).,easy,factual
saudi_ibd_006,Describe the data quality control process and filtering thresholds used in this study,"For quality control, the mean number of reads per sample was 1,198,986 and median was 1,182,939. The middle 50% of the distribution of reads per sample ranged from 917,332 to 1,474,985. Only samples with at least 25,000 reads were retained for downstream analyses, bringing the total to 227 samples. A 10% prevalence filter was chosen to maximize statistical power, leaving 2,502 OTUs in the taxa-pruned dataset. Reads were agglomerated at the genus level as approximately 41% of OTUs were uncharacterized at the species level, resulting in 198 distinct OTUs.",medium,mechanism
saudi_ibd_007,What statistical methods were used to assess beta diversity and differential abundance?,"Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed to evaluate differences in microbial community structure using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix. A PERMANOVA model was used to assess the effect of diagnosis, sex, diabetes status, region of sample collection, family history of IBD, number of family members with IBD, and nationality on beta diversity. The DESeq2 package (v 1.32.0) was used to test for differential abundance of OTUs by modeling counts using the negative binomial distribution, with the design formula modeling DESeq2 normalized counts as a function of area, nationality, diagnosis, diabetes status, and age bin.",medium,mechanism
saudi_ibd_008,What were the key findings regarding age as a factor in microbiome diversity?,"Age was found to be statistically significant (p-value=5e-04) in explaining microbiome variation, but only explained approximately 7% of the variation in the data (R²=0.0665). Patients were sorted into three age bins (0-27 years, 28-36 years, and >36 years) for analysis. The only variables to show statistically significant effect on beta diversity were family history of IBD and the number of family members affected by IBD, but only in the 0-27 age bin. Age was categorized into 6 distinct bins for visualization: [4-15.8], [15.8-27.7], [27.7-39.5], [39.5-51.3], [51.3-63.2], and [63.2-75] years.",medium,mechanism
saudi_ibd_009,How did the study's findings regarding Lachnoclostridium differ from previous IBD research?,"Lachnoclostridium was observed as significantly upregulated in the Saudi CD population, which to the authors' knowledge had not been observed in any previous studies to date. One small study of CD versus UC subjects showed it was upregulated in UC patients but not CD subjects. Lachnoclostridium was recently observed to be upregulated in response to a high protein diet and associated with colonic mucus thickness, though a clear link with UC or IBD in general had not been well elucidated. This represents a potentially unique finding in the Saudi Arabian population.",medium,comparison
saudi_ibd_010,What species-level findings were consistent between both UC and CD groups compared to controls?,"At the species level, both UC and CD groups had a larger abundance of Blautia hansenii, which has been previously shown to be associated with visceral fat accumulation, when compared to controls. Additionally, both CD and UC patients saw a lower abundance of multiple species of Prevotella, which is consistent with what other studies have shown in IBD populations.",medium,factual
saudi_ibd_011,What was the prevalence and characteristics of Type-2 Diabetes in the IBD cohort?,"In the overall 219 IBD cases, 8 subjects (3.6%) had confirmed Type-2 Diabetes and 6 subjects (2.7%) had borderline T2D, as assessed by HbA1C readings and physician notes. The median HbA1c level was 5.7% [IQR 5.1-6.1]. Family history of T2D was evident in 16 IBD subjects (7.3%). There was a statistically significant difference in diabetes prevalence between IBD cases and controls (p=0.013), with no controls having confirmed or borderline diabetes.",medium,factual
saudi_ibd_012,Compare the findings of this Saudi Arabian study to typical Western IBD microbiome studies and explain why differences might exist,"The study hypothesized that key IBD-associated microbes may be distinctly different in Middle Eastern versus Western populations due to cultural and dietary dissimilarities. Indeed, they observed several microbial genera that were not well characterized in prior IBD studies, including Lachnoclostridium (upregulated in CD), Harryflintia (associated with high-fat diet in mice but less known in CD), and specific patterns of Akkermansia abundance. Only a subset of OTUs were overlapping with UC versus CD characterizations by Jansson and colleagues, suggesting that classification algorithms trained largely on IBD subjects of European ancestry may not perform well when applied to participants from the Middle East. This highlights the importance of population-specific microbiome studies.",hard,comparison
saudi_ibd_013,Explain the epidemiological trends of IBD in Saudi Arabia from the 1980s to the study period and the factors contributing to these changes,"Prior to the 1980s, IBD was considered rare in Saudi Arabia and surrounding regions, but the incidence has been gradually increasing over the last four decades. Prospective studies observed an incidence of 5 per million and prevalence of 50 per million for IBD in children from 1993 to 2002. The annual incidence of CD was 3.2 cases per million from 1983 to 1992, rising to 16.6 cases per million from 1993 to 2002. This increase parallels significant changes in industrialization and lifestyle over the last four decades, which greatly impacted dietary and sedentary behaviors. Dietary factors, medication, and smoking are postulated to contribute to the increased CD pathogenesis in Saudi Arabia. A retrospective hospital-based study of 312 Saudi IBD subjects from 1970 to 2008 showed the mean age of patients with IBD was 25.5 (SD 10.6) years.",hard,mechanism
saudi_ibd_014,Describe the unsupervised discovery methods used and their findings regarding disease classification,"Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, with the broken-stick test indicating that 2 principal components were most meaningful to retain (explaining 9% and 3% of variance, respectively). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that axes 1 and 2 explained 24% and 14% of variance, respectively. A heatmap of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was created and annotated with categorical metadata. Evidence of structure in the data related to differences in community composition was observed, with groups of samples showing clear differences evident by relatively high Bray-Curtis dissimilarity estimates. However, no clear patterns associated with disease status (IBD diagnosis) were evident in either PCoA scatterplots or heatmaps. The study concluded that IBD status was not a main driver of microbiome dissimilarity in this population, with age (R²=0.0665, p=5e-04) and sex (R²=0.0147, p=0.0379) being the only statistically significant factors, though explaining relatively small proportions of variance.",hard,mechanism
saudi_ibd_015,What were the complete workflow and bioinformatics pipeline used from raw sequencing to final taxonomic classification?,"The workflow began with Illumina software for deconvolution and initial primer/barcode processing. Raw sequences were demultiplexed with Illumina's bcl2fastq2 v2.20 and Seqtk. FastQC was used for quality control to remove samples with low quality scores. The majority of data processing was executed in QIIME2 with custom scripts. Paired-end reads were joined using the VSEARCH function. Chimera amplicon removal and abundance filtering were processed using Deblur. Amplicon sequences were clustered and assembled into OTUs using closed reference clustering against the Greengenes (13_8 database) using VSEARCH. Taxonomic assignment was performed using a pre-trained Naïve Bayes classifier with Greengenes OTU database. The abundance tables from QIIME2 were combined into a Phyloseq object (version 4.1.1), normalized for library size variation using DADA2, and further analyzed in R with custom scripts. The indexed libraries were on average 620 base pairs in length.",hard,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_001,What percentage increase was observed in obese adolescents in the United States between 1988-1994 and 2013-2014?,"In the United States, obese adolescents increased from 10.5% to 20.6% between the period 1988-1994 and 2013-2014, while extremely obese adolescents increased from 2.6% to 9.1%",easy,factual
obesity_microbiota_002,Which bacterial markers were identified as specific to obese adolescents in the study?,"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Actinomyces were assigned as microbial markers specific to obese adolescents, with AUROC values of 0.75 and 0.735 respectively",easy,factual
obesity_microbiota_003,What was the highest ChaoI index value among the four study groups?,"The highest mean value of the ChaoI index was obtained for the CTRL_ado (control adolescent) group at 242.28, followed by CTRL_adult (180.23), ob_ado (166.03), and ob_adult (149.28) groups",easy,factual
obesity_microbiota_004,How many total sequencing reads were obtained from the 69 fecal samples in this study?,"A total of 139,783.00 sequencing reads were obtained from 69 fecal samples, with a mean value of 2,025.84 sequences per sample. Overall, 222 OTUs were identified, grouped in 14 phylum and 79 families",easy,factual
obesity_microbiota_005,Which bacterial markers were associated with normal weight adolescents?,"Five microbial markers were associated with normal weight adolescents: Parabacteroides (AUROC 0.706), Rikenellaceae (AUROC 0.731), Bacteroides caccae (AUROC 0.781), Barnesiellaceae (AUROC 0.848), and Oscillospira (AUROC 0.725)",easy,factual
obesity_microbiota_006,Explain the role of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the gut microbiota of obese adolescents,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is one of the most common species in the gastrointestinal tract of adults consuming a Western diet and has a key role in host metabolism as it allows the fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate. Its presence in the gut of obese adolescents may lead to increased energy recovery from unabsorbed carbohydrate that would not otherwise contribute to dietary energy intake. Its presence has also been associated with lower success in weight loss diets,medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_007,How does the gut microbiota influence host energy metabolism according to the study?,"The gut microbiota influences host energy metabolism through multiple mechanisms: it is involved in the degradation of non-digestible nutrients such as plant polysaccharides and fibers, contributes to nutrition and metabolic health, and can affect inflammation and insulin sensitivity. Modulation of the gut microbiota by consumption of fiber, antibiotic treatment or fecal transplantation can have positive effects on inflammation and insulin sensitivity",medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_008,What were the key differences in metabolic pathways between obese and normal weight adolescents?,"Thirty-four KEGG pathways were upregulated in obese adolescents while 26 were upregulated in normal weight adolescents. For obese adolescents, the upregulated pathways included primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid acids biosynthesis, fructose and mannose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, galactose metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and pentose phosphate metabolism. For normal weight adolescents, upregulated pathways included glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, secondary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and lipoic acid metabolism",medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_009,Describe the correlation patterns between bacterial species and clinical characteristics in obese adolescents,"In obese adolescents, Erysipelotrichaceae negatively correlated with BMI, Anaerostipes negatively correlated with age, while Prevotella distasonis positively correlated with age. Diabetes was positively correlated with the presence of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella copri and Prevotella distasonis, while no OTU correlated with hypertension and gender features",medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_010,What role does Actinomyces play in obesity and how is it related to dietary factors?,"Actinomyces species are part of the normal, resident microbiota of the mouth and contributed to different plaque related diseases. They have been correlated with a glucose diet and were found to be related to the gut microbiota of obese adolescents in this study. In two case reports, Actinomyces were found responsible for gastric actinomycosis as a complication after gastric bypass for morbid obesity",medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_011,What is the significance of Parabacteroides distasonis in the gut microbiota and its relationship with body weight?,"Parabacteroides distasonis is prominently found in the gut of healthy individuals and is one of the markers associated with normal weight adolescents (AUROC 0.706). Studies in humans and in mouse models have demonstrated a positive correlation between Bacteroidetes phylum members and weight loss. In this study, P. distasonis positively correlated with age in obese adolescents",medium,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_012,Compare the gut microbiota composition differences between obese adolescents and obese adults in terms of phylum-level distribution,"The distribution of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were statistically significant for the obese adolescent/obese adult comparison, with Actinobacteria levels being higher in the obese adolescent group, and Bacteroidetes levels being uppermost in the obese adult group. At the species level, Actinomyces, Adlercreutzia, Collinsella aerofaciens and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly higher in obese adolescents compared to obese adults",hard,comparison
obesity_microbiota_013,Explain the differential metabolic pathway enrichment between adolescent and adult obese patients and its implications,"Twenty KEGG pathways differentiated adolescent and adult obese patients. Adolescent obese microbiota showed higher lipopolysaccharide metabolism (associated with inflammation and insulin resistance), folate, vitamin B6, inositol phosphate, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Adult obese microbiota showed higher arginine and proline, amino and nucleotide sugar, and starch and sucrose galactose metabolism pathways. This suggests age-dependent metabolic differences in obesity, with adolescents showing more inflammation-related processes while adults show enhanced carbohydrate breakdown pathways",hard,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_014,"How does the discriminant analysis model perform in classifying the four study groups, and what does this reveal about microbiota-based classification?","The discriminant analysis showed that 98.6% of the original grouped cases were correctly classified, and the canonical discriminant plot revealed clear separation between obese and control groups. However, when applying cross-validation, only 34.8% of cases were correctly classified, revealing a low capability of the entire OTUs set to discriminate the four groups. This led researchers to select only 12 OTUs (p < 0.05 from Wilks' Lambda test) for better discrimination. The model successfully identified specific markers for obese adolescents and normal weight adolescents (AUROC > 0.7), but could not accurately discriminate adult groups (AUROC < 0.7), suggesting age-dependent microbiota patterns are more distinct in adolescents",hard,mechanism
obesity_microbiota_015,What is the relationship between secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways and obesity status in adolescents?,"Secondary bile acid biosynthesis was significantly associated with normal weight adolescents rather than obese adolescents, while primary bile acid biosynthesis was associated with obese adolescents. Primary bile acids (cholate and chenodeoxycholate) are deconjugated by gram-positive bacterial species such as Lactobacilli. After deconjugation, additional microbial modifications by Clostridium species give rise to secondary bile acids, which influence energy expenditure and glucose homeostasis via their effects on gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. This suggests that normal weight adolescents have a more metabolically favorable bile acid profile",hard,mechanism
microbiome_richness_001,What percentage of the study population had low bacterial richness (LGC)?,"Low bacterial richness (LGC) individuals represented 23% of the total study population of 292 non-obese and obese Danish individuals. These LGC individuals had on average 380,000 genes, while HGC individuals had 640,000 genes, a difference of approximately 40%",easy,factual
microbiome_richness_002,How many bacterial genes were detected in the total study sample and what distribution pattern was observed?,"A total of 139,783.00 sequencing reads were obtained from 69 fecal samples, with a mean value of 2,025.84 sequences per sample. Overall, 222 OTUs were identified, grouped in 14 phylum and 79 families. The comparison of gene number across the 292 individuals showed a bimodal distribution of bacterial genes, with LGC individuals having fewer than 480,000 genes and HGC individuals having more",easy,factual
microbiome_richness_003,Which bacterial genera were significantly more abundant in LGC versus HGC individuals?,"Eight genera were more dominant in LGC individuals: Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus (specifically R. torques and R. gnavus), Campylobacter, Dialister, Porphyromonas, Staphylococcus and Anaerostipes. In contrast, 36 genera were significantly associated with HGC individuals, including Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Butyrivibrio, Alistipes, Akkermansia, Coprococcus and Methanobrevibacter",easy,factual
microbiome_richness_004,What was the AUC value achieved in distinguishing LGC from HGC individuals using bacterial species?,"The best combination of four bacterial species gave an AUC value of 0.98 in the ROC analysis for distinguishing LGC from HGC individuals. In a tenfold cross-validation test with 90% of randomly chosen individuals, the AUC value was 0.97 ± 0.02 (mean ± s.d.) for the remaining 10%, indicating the robustness of the analysis",easy,factual
microbiome_richness_005,What was the total number of genes that differed significantly between LGC and HGC individuals?,"A total of 120,723 genes were found to differ significantly between LGC and HGC individuals in all 60 tests at P < 0.0001. Of these, 10,225 genes (8.5%) were assigned to a total of 97 genomes representing some 73 species at a threshold of 95% identity over at least 90% of the gene length. However, a vast majority (93.4%) belonged to only 9 species",easy,factual
microbiome_richness_006,Explain the gene clustering methodology used to identify bacterial species in the study,"The study used an abundance covariance-based clustering approach. The hypothesis was that genes from a given bacterial species should be present at similar abundance in an individual but display large variations across a cohort (10-10,000 fold). Spearman correlation coefficients were computed for each gene with all other genes, and those correlated above a threshold of rho > 0.85 were grouped together. In total, 76,564 genes (63% of 120,723) were grouped into 1,440 clusters of two or more genes. Some 58 clusters contained ≥75 genes and included 90% of the genes, with 52 containing genes from previously unknown species",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_007,How did the metabolic pathways differ between LGC and HGC individuals?,"LGC individuals had higher abundance of peroxidase, catalase and TCA modules, suggesting increased capacity to handle oxidative stress. They also had higher genomic potential for production of metabolites with possible deleterious effects, including β-glucuronide degradation, degradation of aromatic amino acids, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction. HGC individuals were characterized by potentially increased production of organic acids including lactate, propionate and butyrate, combined with higher hydrogen production potential. A shift from methanogenic/acetogenic ecosystem in HGC to sulphate-reducing in LGC was also observed",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_008,What inflammatory and metabolic phenotypes characterized LGC individuals?,"LGC individuals were characterized by more marked overall adiposity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, increased triglycerides and free fatty acids, decreased HDL-cholesterol, and dyslipidemia. They showed a more pronounced inflammatory phenotype with increased highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (2.3 vs 1.4 mg/l) and higher white blood cell counts (6.4 vs 5.6 × 10^9/l). LGC individuals also had increased serum leptin (17.0 vs 8.3 μg/l) and decreased serum adiponectin (7.5 vs 9.6 μg/l) compared to HGC individuals",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_009,Describe the relationship between gut microbiota richness and weight gain over time in obese individuals,"Obese LGC individuals gained significantly more weight than HGC individuals during the past 9 years (P = 0.006). The BMI change was significant both without and with linear adjustment for baseline BMI and age. Eight bacterial species were found to be associated with BMI change, and all eight were more abundant in HGC than in LGC individuals. The average weight gain of individuals with lowest or undetectable levels of these species was greater than those with highest species levels, suggesting these species may protect against weight gain",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_010,What is the proposed mechanism linking gut microbiota imbalance to metabolic dysfunction?,"The study proposes that an imbalance of potentially pro- and anti-inflammatory bacterial species triggers low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. The altered gut microbiota of LGC individuals induces an increase in serum fasting induced adipose factor (FIAF/ANGPLT4), eliciting increased release of triglycerides and free fatty acids. LGC individuals harbor an inflammation-associated microbiota with reduced butyrate-producing bacteria, increased mucus degradation potential, reduced hydrogen and methane production combined with increased hydrogen sulphide formation, and increased Campylobacter/Shigella abundance",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_011,How does Faecalibacterium prausnitzii relate to gut microbiota richness and inflammation?,"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is an anti-inflammatory commensal bacterium that is more prevalent in HGC individuals compared to LGC individuals. It has been identified as a beneficial species through gut microbiota analysis of Crohn's disease patients. The distribution of anti-inflammatory species like F. prausnitzii contrasts with potentially pro-inflammatory Bacteroides and Ruminococcus gnavus, which are associated with inflammatory bowel disease and found more frequently in LGC individuals",medium,mechanism
microbiome_richness_012,Compare the discrimination power of gut microbiome versus human genome in distinguishing lean from obese individuals,"For distinguishing lean (BMI < 25 kg/m²) from obese (BMI > 30 kg/m²) individuals, only 15,894 significantly different genes were found, indicating that the gut microbiota differs less between lean and obese than between LGC and HGC individuals. These genes were attributed to 18 bacterial species by clustering. The best AUC achieved was 0.78 with nine species in a ROC analysis with tenfold cross validation. This accuracy, while lower than the 0.98 for LGC/HGC separation, is substantially better than an AUC of 0.58 achieved by ROC analysis of 32 human genome loci associated with adiposity measures, suggesting that the obesity-associated signal in the human gut microbiome is much stronger than that presently known in the human genome",hard,comparison
microbiome_richness_013,Describe the validation methods used to confirm that clustered genes originated from the same bacterial species,"Five validation approaches were used: (1) BLASTN taxonomic assignments showed high coherence for genes within clusters; (2) Abundance covariance was computed across Danish (292 individuals) and French (49 individuals) cohorts, showing genes co-varied in both datasets; (3) Abundance similarity was assessed by computing the ratio of standard deviation to mean, showing small scores indicating homogeneity; (4) k-mer composition (tetranucleotide profiles) showed highly correlated profiles for genes within clusters (genes: 1,135 ± 446 bp; contigs: 4,084 ± 3,678 bp); (5) Physical linkage analysis showed that on average 18% of genes from known and unknown clusters were present on the same scaffold, while randomly composed clusters had none (P < 2 × 10^-16)",hard,mechanism
microbiome_richness_014,What evidence suggests that low gut bacterial richness is associated with multiple chronic diseases beyond obesity?,"Low richness of gut microbiota has been reported in multiple conditions: inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD), elderly patients with inflammation, and obese individuals. The study suggests that low-grade inflammation associated with a plethora of chronic diseases may share a common feature of low gut bacterial richness. The LGC phenotype includes features that bring individuals at increased risk of pre-diabetes, type-2 diabetes and ischaemic cardiovascular disorders. The functional capacity suggests LGC individuals harbor an inflammation-associated microbiota, and whether low gut bacterial richness is common to many or all chronic diseases could be revealed by exploring gut microbiota at a deep metagenomic level in a broad variety of these afflictions",hard,mechanism
microbiome_richness_015,Explain the HITChip analysis results and their concordance with metagenomic sequencing for bacterial richness assessment,"HITChip analysis, based on 16S ribosomal DNA phylogenetic marker, confirmed the bimodal distribution and difference in richness between LGC and HGC individuals. From 3,699 unique HITChip probes, probes accounting for the top 99.9% of total signal were selected and counted for richness measurement, ranging from 713 to 1,597 probes per sample. The correlation with read mapping was very high (Pearson's r of 0.85 and 0.90 in HGC and LGC individuals, respectively). For 33 of 46 genera that differed significantly between groups, genus probes were present on HITChip and their abundance was determined. The Pearson correlation coefficient between log(gene count) and log(probe count) was 0.8, and concordance between assignments to low or high richness class was 88%",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_001,What was the total number of tuberculosis patients enrolled in the study who provided fecal samples at all three time points?,"Out of 204 tuberculosis patients diagnosed during the study period, 85 patients provided fecal samples at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months during treatment. The average age was 41.8±15.193 years, with a gender ratio of 77 males to 8 females",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_002,What percentage of tuberculosis patients reported being free of gastrointestinal symptoms during anti-tuberculosis treatment?,"Only 28.2% of the cohort reported being free of gastrointestinal symptoms during anti-tuberculosis treatment, meaning 71.8% experienced gastrointestinal symptoms. Nausea and vomiting were the most reported symptoms, followed by heartburn and acid reflux",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_003,What are the four first-line drugs used in the standard 6-month anti-tuberculosis treatment regimen?,"The four first-line drugs are isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB). Treatment consists of INH, RIF, EMB and PZA in the first 2 months (intensive phase) followed by INH and RIF in the following 4 months (continuation phase)",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_004,Which four cities in Jiangsu Province were selected as research sites for this multi-center study?,"The four cities selected were Wuxi, Changzhou, Taizhou and Xuzhou city, representing geographical, demographic, and economic variations across southern, central, and northern Jiangsu Province in eastern China",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_005,What were the top four predominant bacterial phyla in the gut microbiome of tuberculosis patients?,"The top four bacterial phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota, which accounted for more than 90% of the abundance. The dominant species remained the same throughout treatment, but their relative abundances varied",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_006,How does anti-tuberculosis treatment affect gut microbiota diversity over the course of treatment?,"Anti-tuberculosis treatment significantly reduces gut microbiota diversity, with a transient decrease in alpha diversity indices observed after two months. Patients at baseline had higher alpha diversity (Shannon index 2.92±0.93) compared to after 2 months of treatment (2.50±0.84, P=0.0014). The diversity recovered slightly after 6 months of treatment but remained lower than baseline, and the recovery process was slow and potentially incomplete",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_007,Explain how the gut microbiota influences the immune response to tuberculosis through short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs),"Bacteria within the Bacteroidota phylum utilize dietary fibers to produce SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). SCFAs serve as energy sources for colonocytes, regulate host fatty acid and lipid synthesis, maintain gut microbiota stability, elevate anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and reduce inflammation, and regulate the immune system including immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. SCFAs act as signaling molecules that travel throughout the body via bloodstream, aiding in immune system regulation",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_008,What changes occur to Proteobacteria abundance during and after the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment?,"Proteobacteria exhibited a significant increase during the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment, rising from 13.36% at baseline to 25.06% at 2 months (P=0.008). After the intensive treatment phase ended, Proteobacteria showed a significant decrease from 25.06% to 16.47% at 6 months (P=0.006), demonstrating a pattern of increasing then decreasing relative abundance",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_009,Describe the role of Firmicutes in systemic immune responses and how anti-tuberculosis treatment affects this phylum,"Firmicutes produce SCFAs and control systemic immune responses through their cell wall glycoconjugates, notably by facilitating the release of IL-34, which activates macrophages and bolsters defensive capabilities against pulmonary inflammation. The cell wall glycoconjugates of Firmicutes more readily traverse the intestinal barrier, gaining access to the host's systemic circulation and persisting within the body, thereby enhancing their ability to modulate systemic immunity. Anti-tuberculosis therapy is associated with a reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, potentially exerting consequential effects on the immune system",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_010,How does the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) assess gastrointestinal symptoms in tuberculosis patients?,"The GSRS is a self-report questionnaire developed by Svedlund et al. that assesses the severity and frequency of common gastrointestinal symptoms. It encompasses 15 gastrointestinal-related symptoms including abdominal pain, heartburn, acid reflux, upper abdominal tightness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal rumbling, abdominal distension, belching, increased flatulence, reduced defecation, increased defecation, loose stools, hard stools, urgency of defecation, and feeling of incomplete evacuation. Items are rated along a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none/nothing or symptom does not occur) to 3 (very frequent and troublesome symptom), with patients graded based on degree, frequency, duration, mitigating factors, and impact on social activities",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_011,What is the gut-lung axis and how does it relate to tuberculosis pathogenesis?,"The gut-lung axis refers to the bidirectional relationship where the gut microbiota can influence respiratory diseases and vice versa. Intestinal disorders may affect the lungs through lung inflammation, as both have similar immune messengers and inflammatory processes. The relationship between gut microbiota and respiratory diseases may be related to classic immune inflammatory pathways such as the T cell family and pattern recognition receptors. TNF-α, inflammatory factors such as IL-22 and their regulatory substances constitute the common substance of the intestinal lung axis, which may be related to drug resistance. Intestinal microbiota can regulate the immune response of lung tissue through SCFAs, cytokines, and other factors, thereby affecting the development and outcome of lung diseases including tuberculosis",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_012,Compare the changes in Bacteroidota abundance throughout the anti-tuberculosis treatment course and explain their significance,"Bacteroidota showed a significant decrease in genus abundance both before and after the start of the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Specifically, it decreased from 11.95% at baseline to 7.69% at 2 months (P=0.04), and further decreased from baseline 11.95% to 6.64% at 6 months (P=0.006). This is significant because bacteria within the Bacteroidota phylum are capable of utilizing dietary fibers to produce SCFAs, which are crucial for colonocyte energy, immune regulation, and inflammatory response. The sustained reduction throughout treatment suggests prolonged impairment of SCFA production capacity, potentially affecting immune function and gut homeostasis",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_013,Describe the dynamic changes in Escherichia-Shigella and Akkermansia genera during anti-tuberculosis treatment and their potential clinical implications,"Escherichia-Shigella demonstrated a significant increase during the intensive phase (from 11.44% to 21.11%, P=0.003), followed by a significant decrease after the intensive treatment phase (from 21.11% to 14.85%, P=0.026). Escherichia-Shigella has been found to dominate gut microbiome dysbiosis in tuberculous meningitis patients and could serve as a strong indicator for forecasting microbiota dysbiosis triggered by anti-tuberculosis treatment. Conversely, Akkermansia exhibited a decrease during the intensive phase (from 2.29% to 1.61%, P=0.427), followed by a gradual increase afterward (from 1.61% to 3.59%, P=0.117). Akkermansia muciniphila or its metabolite palmitoleic acid has been shown to suppress Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in animal models, though its role may be influenced by multiple factors",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_014,What were the specific changes observed in the genus Enterococcus during anti-tuberculosis treatment and what are the potential clinical concerns?,"Enterococcus showed a decrease in relative abundance during the intensive phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (from 1.31% to 0.40%, P=0.168), but then rapidly increased afterward, far exceeding the levels before the start of treatment (from 0.40% to 2.66%, P=0.007). This is clinically concerning because while Enterococcus can enhance gastrointestinal adhesion by producing extracellular polysaccharides and facilitate probiotic colonization, in tuberculosis patients undergoing long-term antibiotic therapy or with compromised immunity, Enterococcus are prone to translocation leading to enterococcal infections. Moreover, their ability to accumulate mutations and acquire exogenous genetic elements confers additional antibiotic resistance, rendering Enterococcus as one of the major nosocomial pathogens, suggesting potential drug resistance or pathogenic risk",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_015,What were the key methodological approaches used for gut microbiome analysis in this study?,"The study extracted total microbial genomic DNA from fecal samples and amplified the hypervariable region V3-V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers 338F and 806R. Purified amplicons were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina PE300/PE250 platform. Raw FASTQ files were quality filtered by fastp version 0.19.6 and merged by FLASH version 1.2.11. Optimized sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UPARSE 11 with 97% sequence similarity level. The number of 16S rRNA gene sequences from each sample was rarefied to 20,000, yielding an average Good's coverage of 99.09%. Alpha diversity indices (observed OTUs, Chao1 richness, Shannon index) and beta diversity using Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity were calculated",medium,factual
ptb_microbiota_001,What percentage of the global population is infected with tuberculosis?,"A quarter of the global population (25%) is infected with tuberculosis, and approximately 3-5% of these individuals will develop active TB during their lifetime",easy,factual
ptb_microbiota_002,How many participants were included in the study comparing PTB patients to healthy controls?,"The study included 83 patients diagnosed with untreated active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs), for a total of 135 participants",easy,factual
ptb_microbiota_003,What cholesterol-related parameters were significantly lower in PTB patients?,"PTB patients had significantly lower levels of total cholesterol (Tch), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) compared to healthy controls",easy,factual
ptb_microbiota_004,How many operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in the study?,"The sequencing reads were clustered into 875 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a similarity of 97%, with 99 OTUs unique to the healthy control group and 74 OTUs unique to the PTB group",easy,factual
ptb_microbiota_005,Which bacterial phylum showed considerable reduction in PTB patients?,The bacterial phylum Firmicutes showed considerable downregulation in PTB patients. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was 63.81% in healthy controls but only 48.84% in the PTB group,easy,factual
ptb_microbiota_006,Explain how Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection affects the production of short-chain fatty acids in the gut,"Mtb infection contributes to a significant decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces. The levels of isobutyric acid, butyric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, and valeric acid were markedly lower in PTB patients compared to healthy controls. This reduction is associated with decreased abundances of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, and Roseburia",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_007,What is the gut-lung axis and how does it relate to tuberculosis?,"The gut-lung axis refers to the bidirectional cross-talk between intestinal bacteria and the lung. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is relevant to numerous lung diseases including pulmonary tuberculosis. For example, modulation of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) by gut bacteria plays important roles in regulating the immune response to Mtb that is dependent on dendritic cells in the lung",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_008,How does the alpha diversity of gut microbiota differ between PTB patients and healthy controls?,"PTB patients had significantly lower alpha diversity compared to healthy controls across all measured indexes. The number of observed species was 206.17±52.17 in PTB patients versus 254.02±44.65 in healthy controls. The Chao1, ACE, Shannon, and Simpson indexes were all significantly lower in the PTB group, indicating reduced phylogenetic diversity and species richness",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_009,Describe the changes in bacterial families observed at the family level in PTB patients,"At the family level, PTB patients showed significantly greater abundances of Bacteroidaceae (30.36% vs. 17.19%), Tannerellaceae (2.38% vs. 0.94%), Fusobacteriaceae (2.15% vs. 0.17%), and Erysipelotrichaceae (1.44% vs. 0.89%). Conversely, they had markedly lower abundances of Bifidobacteriaceae (0.9% vs. 4.99%), Lachnospiraceae (23.89% vs. 33.95%), Ruminococcaceae (15.51% vs. 21.59%), and several other families",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_010,How do short-chain fatty acids benefit human health and what role might their reduction play in PTB?,"SCFAs, particularly butyrate, inhibit inflammation through various mechanisms including induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs), maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, and provision of energy to intestinal cells. The significant reduction in SCFAs in PTB patients may compromise immune function and intestinal barrier integrity, potentially contributing to disease susceptibility and progression",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_011,What role does indole propionic acid play in tuberculosis infection?,"Indole propionic acid, produced by intestinal bacteria, has been demonstrated to have potential limitation effects on Mycobacterium tuberculosis both in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that certain gut bacteria-derived metabolites may have direct antimycobacterial activity and could influence disease outcomes",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_012,"Compare the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes between PTB patients and healthy controls, and explain the significance","In healthy controls, Firmicutes comprised 63.81% and Bacteroidetes 27.82% of the gut microbiota. In PTB patients, there was a dramatic shift with Firmicutes decreasing to 48.84% and Bacteroidetes increasing to 44.92%. This shift represents a significant dysbiosis, as Firmicutes include many SCFA-producing bacteria that are beneficial for immune function and gut health. The increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes ratio is associated with reduced metabolic diversity and compromised immune responses",hard,comparison
ptb_microbiota_013,Describe the performance of the random forest classification models for distinguishing PTB patients from healthy controls,"Two random forest models were developed: a microbiome-based model using 30 genus markers achieved an AUC of 0.872 for the training set and 0.851 for the test set. A metabolomics-based model using 12 differential metabolites achieved superior performance with an AUC of 0.993 for the training set and 0.998 for the test set. Four genera (Fusobacterium, Fusicatenibacter, Tyzzerella, and Anaerotruncus) had individual AUC values above 0.7, and their combination yielded an AUC of 0.81",hard,comparison
ptb_microbiota_014,"How do the metabolomic profiles differ between PTB patients and healthy controls, and what pathways are affected?","A total of 744 different metabolite features were examined, with 26 showing significant alterations (17 elevated and 9 downregulated in PTB patients). The OPLS-DA model (R2X=0.456, Q2=0.752) showed clear separation between groups. Altered metabolites are involved in multiple pathways including ABC transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling, sulfur metabolism, galactose metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. Notable changes included decreased levels of indoxyl sulfate, squalene, and o-phosphoserine, and increased levels of taurine, aconitic acid, and tromethamine",hard,mechanism
ptb_microbiota_015,"Explain the correlations found between gut microbiota, faecal metabolites, and biochemical parameters in PTB patients","The study revealed multiple significant correlations: Five metabolites enriched in healthy controls (indoxyl sulfate, resorcinol, orcinol, inositol, and o-phosphoserine) were positively correlated with beneficial bacteria like Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, and Ruminococcaceae. Thirteen upregulated metabolites in PTB patients (including taurine, aconitic acid, and tromethamine) were negatively correlated with beneficial bacteria like Blautia, Roseburia, and Butyricicoccus. Cholesterol levels (Tch, LDL, VLDL) were positively associated with Romboutsia and Fusicatenibacter and negatively with Cetobacterium and Weissella. These correlations suggest that gut dysbiosis directly influences host metabolism and may contribute to the altered lipid profiles and nutritional status observed in PTB patients",hard,mechanism
tb_fermentation_001,How many treatment-naive TB patients and healthy donors were included in this gut microbiome study?,The study used deep sequencing of fecal samples from 23 treatment-naive TB patients and 48 healthy donors to reconstruct the gut microbiome's metabolic capacity and strain/species-level content. There was no significant difference in sex or age between the participating TB patients and healthy controls (p < 0.05),easy,factual
tb_fermentation_002,What proportion of the total gut microbiota was comprised by disease-associated pathobionts in TB patients?,"The cumulative expansion of diverse disease-associated pathobionts in TB patients reached 1/4 (25%) of the total gut microbiota, suggesting a heavy toll on host immunity along with MTB infection. This extent of pathobiont burden poses a significant challenge to the immune system",easy,factual
tb_fermentation_003,What were the main phylum-level taxonomic changes observed in TB patients compared to healthy controls?,"TB patients showed systematic depletion of Bacteroidetes (54% vs. 72.2% in controls) and increases in Firmicutes (36.4% vs. 21.3%, p = 0.03), Actinobacteria (1.8% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.0002), and Proteobacteria (5.6% vs. 3.8%, p > 0.05). This increase in Firmicutes was at the expense of Bacteroidetes, a frequent sign of a disturbed gut microbiome",easy,factual
tb_fermentation_004,Which bacterial species were strongly enriched in TB patients according to LEfSe analysis with LDA scores ≥ 4.5?,"Bacterial species strongly enriched in TB patients (LDA ≥ 4.5) included Phocaeicola dorei, Escherichia coli, Prevotella copri clade C, and Akkermansia muciniphila. In contrast, Phocaeicola vulgatus, Alistipes putredinis, Prevotella copri clade B, and Prevotella SGB1589 were more abundant in healthy controls",easy,factual
tb_fermentation_005,What was the effect size (Cohen's d) of tuberculosis status on the gut microbiome compared to other common factors?,"For TB status, effect size on PCs based on taxonomic and metabolic pathways varied between 4.5 and 1.8, respectively. TB therefore impacts the gut microbiome much stronger than autoimmune diseases (Cohen's d=0.2), and many known confounding factors, such as diet and lifestyle factors reported in the American Gut Project (Cohen's d did not exceed 0.2 and Cohen's f <0.1)",medium,factual
tb_fermentation_006,Describe how the metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome differs between TB patients and healthy controls,"Reconstruction of metabolic pathways showed that the microbial community in TB patients shifted toward rapid growth using glycolysis and excess fermentation to produce acetate and lactate. In total, 131 metabolic pathways were differentially enriched, with 120 pathways overrepresented in TB patients' microbiomes (p ≤ 0.05). When clustered into higher-level MetaCyc pathway groups, this increase in metabolic capacity revealed an elevation in biosynthetic processes supporting microbial cell division and growth. This contrasts with healthy donors, where metabolic pathways reflect normal bacterial cell functioning",medium,mechanism
tb_fermentation_007,What are the key metabolic pathways that were most elevated in TB patients' gut microbiomes?,"The gut microbiome in TB patients is characterized by increased metabolic pathways aimed at glucose consumption and fermentation. Specifically, glycolysis (ANAGLYCOLYSIS-PWY), homolactic fermentation (ANAEROFRUCAT-PWY), pentose phosphate pathway (NONOXIPENT-PWY and PENTOSE-P-PWY), and pyruvate fermentation to acetate and (S)-lactate I (P41-PWY) were the top changes. Higher glucose availability in the intestine likely drives fermentation to lactate and growth, causing acidosis and endotoxemia",medium,mechanism
tb_fermentation_008,How does lactic acidosis affect the gut microbiome composition and why is this significant?,"Lactic acidosis strongly suppresses the normal gut flora from Bacteroidetes and provides a carbon source for competitors such as pathogenic Proteobacteria or lactate-utilizing Firmicutes species. Observed taxonomic changes closely mirrored experimentally established effects of lactate acidosis on human colon microbiota, showing depletion of Bacteroidetes and increase of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and pH-tolerant Firmicutes. This destabilizes resident flora and promotes pathogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, C. difficile, and Vibrio cholerae that are adapted to low pH and benefit from lactate consumption",medium,mechanism
tb_fermentation_009,Explain the relationship between increased glycolysis and bacterial growth in TB patients' gut microbiomes,Higher flux of glucose causes most bacteria to prefer glycolysis to grow and divide rapidly. Glycolysis supports 110 times faster generation of biosynthetic precursors and energy in terms of ATP but rapidly produces lactate. Higher use of glucose oxidation (glycolysis) compared to healthy controls indicates higher glucose availability in patients' intestines. Glycolysis supports a higher rate of generating ATP and biosynthetic precursors for dividing bacteria. A relatively higher presence of the pentose phosphate pathway also indicates higher glucose consumption and reactions that synthesize additional biosynthetic precursors needed for dividing cells,medium,mechanism
tb_fermentation_010,What bacterial families contributed most to the increased homolactic fermentation pathway in TB patients?,"Major contributors to increased homolactic fermentation included representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), Streptococcaceae (Streptococcus thermophilus, S. salivarius, S. parasanguinis, and S. gallolyticus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Clostridium innocuum). These families were also among major contributors to higher glycolysis. Homolactic acid fermentation is used by lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and many Streptococci, as well as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae",hard,mechanism
tb_fermentation_011,How does lactate directly interfere with the host's immune response to tuberculosis?,"Lactate has a multifaceted effect on the immune response to MTB. On one hand, lactate improves clearance of MTB in already infected macrophages by promoting autophagy. On the other hand, it markedly suppresses both TNF-α and IFN-γ but leaves IL6 and IL10 unaffected, thereby interfering with further enhancement of anti-MTB activity. Moreover, lactate specifically upregulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that cause lung destruction in tuberculosis, a process known to result in higher morbidity and mortality in TB treatment. The balance between antibacterial activity of macrophages and tissue destruction by extracellular enzymes is critical to disease outcome and transmission",hard,mechanism
tb_fermentation_012,Compare the diversity of Prevotella copri clades between TB patients and healthy controls and explain the significance,"While Prevotella copri clade C proportion was higher in TB patients according to linear discriminant analysis, Prevotella copri clade B was associated with controls. Closer inspection revealed that healthy donors featured a more diverse collection of Prevotella subclades and lineages than TB patients. A recent large-scale study found that Prevotella copri clade diversity was reduced in populations with Westernized diets and disease settings, while non-industrialized societies with fiber-rich traditional diets featured richer diversity. TB patients show reduced diversity of Prevotella copri clades, suggesting that Prevotella copri clade C's association with TB is likely driven by depletion of other lineages rather than a detrimental role of this particular clade",hard,comparison
tb_fermentation_013,"What is the relationship between serum lactate levels and tuberculosis outcomes, and how might gut microbiota contribute?","Serum lactic acidosis is associated with higher mortality during TB treatment and other infections, and monitoring lactate acidosis was shown to help rescue TB patients. Elevated serum lactate correlates with lung pathology and higher mortality. In the context of ongoing inflammation, high lactate in patients' serum can be attributed to glycolytic activity of immune cells and inflamed tissue environment. However, the study's findings point to an additional unacknowledged source for high lactate in patients' sera: the gut microbiota. The higher presence of pathways for lactic acid fermentation and glycolysis indicates a higher propensity of the gut community to acidify the intestine, which may contribute to elevated serum lactate levels",hard,mechanism
tb_fermentation_014,Describe the observed changes in cell wall biosynthesis pathways and identify the major bacterial contributors,"In line with increased bacterial growth in TB patients' intestines, increased biosynthetic pathways supporting cell wall synthesis were observed. Specifically, pathways producing cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and the enterobacterial common antigen increased (DTDPRHAMSYN-PWY; UDPNAGSYN-PWY; PWY-6386; PWY-7315; PWY0-1241; PWY-1269; PWY0-1586). Major contributors (taxa contributing more than 1% of the total) included families: Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Clostridiales, Prevotellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, Hafniaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Vibrionaceae, belonging mainly to phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Several families that contributed to higher cell wall synthesis also contributed to higher presence of pathways for energy production through glycolysis and homolactic fermentation",hard,mechanism
tb_fermentation_015,What novel research focus and potential treatment target does this study propose for tuberculosis?,"The study highlights gut lactate acidosis as a novel research focus for tuberculosis. Since lactic acidosis strongly suppresses normal gut flora, directly interferes with macrophage function, and is linked to mortality in TB patients, if confirmed, gut acidosis may be a novel potential host-directed treatment target to augment traditional TB treatment. The idea to target lactic acidosis in TB treatment as a new host-directed therapy was proposed, and in animal studies, excess fermentation in the gut has long been known to cause lactic acidosis with treatment measures being actively studied. One major source of lactic acidosis can be intestinal microbiota-driven acidosis",medium,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_001,How many cohorts were analyzed in this study and what were their sizes?,"The study analyzed three cohorts: Cohort 1 was a 2-week longitudinal interventional clinical trial with 35 individuals (16 HRZE, 19 NTZ), Cohort 2 was a 6-month longitudinal observational study with 20 individuals at baseline, and Cohort 3 was a cross-sectional study with 55 healthy controls (36 community controls and 19 family contacts)",easy,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_002,What is the clinical trial registration number for the HRZE/NTZ study?,"The clinical trial registration number is NCT02684240, which compared the early bactericidal effect of standard tuberculosis therapy HRZE to the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (NTZ)",easy,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_003,What bacterial classes were primarily depleted by HRZE treatment?,"HRZE treatment primarily depleted members of the class Clostridia, particularly from the order Clostridiales. This included 82 ASVs from genera such as Blautia, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus",easy,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_004,What was the key difference in treatment outcomes between HRZE and NTZ?,"HRZE resulted in a predictable increase in time to positivity (TTP), corresponding to reduced Mtb bacterial load (p<0.001), while NTZ had no significant effect on TTP after 14 days (p>0.05), despite having potent in vitro activity. This lack of NTZ antimicrobial effect was traced to failure of the drug to penetrate the sputum",easy,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_005,Which oxygen-tolerant pathobionts were expanded by NTZ treatment?,"NTZ caused an expansion of oxygen-tolerant pathobionts including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus alactolyticus, and Enterococcus faecium. These representatives of the Order Bacilli and family Enterobacteriaceae are positively selected by antibiotic treatment due to increased gut epithelial oxygenation",easy,factual
gi_microbiota_tb_006,Explain how HRZE and NTZ differently affected peripheral inflammatory gene expression pathways,"HRZE treatment showed significant depletion of inflammatory response pathways at day 14 including IFNα response, IFNγ response, TNFα signaling via NFκB, and IL6 JAK STAT3, consistent with pathogen clearance and disease resolution. In contrast, NTZ showed the opposite effect, with significant enrichment of these same inflammatory pathways (TNFα signaling, IFNγ signaling, type 1 interferon signaling) at day 14, along with enrichment of pathways related to immune dysregulation such as hypoxia, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species",medium,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_007,How did the microbiome diversity change during the 6-month longitudinal HRZE treatment?,"Microbiome diversity dropped after just 7 days of HRZE treatment, increased after 1 month of treatment, but remained significantly lower compared to baseline at the 6-month follow-up timepoint (p<0.05). During the first month, microbiome depletion was evident, but after 2 months, the trajectory changed with 53 ASVs increased in abundance compared to baseline, and at 6 months, 327 ASVs increased in abundance while only 3 remained depleted",medium,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_008,Describe the analytical approach used to decouple microbiome effects from pathogen sterilization,"The study used Random Forest Regression models to assess changes in peripheral inflammatory pathways as a function of both changes in microbiota species abundances and simultaneous changes in Mtb burden (TTP). The NTZ treatment arm served as a natural experimental control because it perturbed the microbiome without affecting Mtb bacterial load, allowing the researchers to isolate microbiome-dependent effects from pathogen-killing effects. Models were trained on 34 paired samples from both longitudinal datasets using 5000 trees with 80-20% train-validation split",medium,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_009,What were the findings regarding TB-associated inflammatory genes after HRZE versus NTZ treatment?,"Out of 363 TB-associated transcripts detected, 157 were significantly affected by HRZE (FDR<0.05), with 144 (92%) renormalizing toward healthy control levels and only 13 (8%) exacerbating. In contrast, only 4 TB-related inflammatory genes were affected by NTZ, and all 4 (100%) were in the exacerbation category, meaning they moved further away from healthy control expression levels",medium,comparison
gi_microbiota_tb_010,How did the study validate microbiome-inflammatory relationships using the healthy control cohort?,"The study performed Random Forest Regression for each Hallmark pathway against the microbiome in 55 healthy controls (19 family contacts and 36 community controls). They found that higher abundance of health-associated Clostridia including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus spp., and Clostridium catus were associated with reduction in pro-inflammatory pathways including IFNα and IFNγ, consistent with findings from the treatment cohorts. This independent validation reinforced that specific gastrointestinal microbiota members correlate with inflammatory peripheral gene expression even in homeostatic conditions",medium,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_011,Explain the concept of the gut-lung axis as it relates to tuberculosis treatment,"The gut-lung axis refers to bidirectional cross-talk between intestinal bacteria and the lung, where gastrointestinal colonization by specific taxa differentially modulates host biology both locally and systemically. In TB treatment, gut microbiota-educated immune cells and small molecules circulate throughout the periphery, affecting systemic immune responses. For example, modulation of macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) by gut bacteria regulates immune response to Mtb in a dendritic cell-dependent manner in the lung. This means antibiotic-induced perturbations of the gut microbiome can influence pulmonary TB disease outcomes through systemic immunomodulation",hard,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_012,Compare the microbiome perturbation effects of HRZE versus NTZ treatment in detail,"HRZE depleted 82 ASVs from Clostridiales including SCFA producers and bile acid transformers, with no differences in alpha diversity at baseline between arms, and both treatments significantly reduced diversity (p<0.01). NTZ had a more substantial disruptive effect, depleting 387 ASVs and enhancing 16 ASVs. NTZ caused reduction of a larger swath of Clostridiales including all but one ASV depleted by HRZE, plus many additional Firmicutes. Critically, NTZ uniquely caused expansion of pathobionts (K. pneumoniae, E. coli, C. freundii, S. alactolyticus, E. faecium) which HRZE did not, representing oxygen-tolerant pathobionts selected by increased gut epithelial oxygenation",hard,comparison
gi_microbiota_tb_013,What were the key findings from the Random Forest Regression modeling regarding predictors of inflammatory pathway changes?,"Random Forest Regression with Permutated Importance and Accumulated Local Effects analysis identified that increase in TTP (decreased Mtb burden) and increased abundance of Clostridia ASVs, especially Cluster IV and XIVa groups (E. rectale, F. prausnitzii, G. formicilis, E. hallii, O. ruminantium, D. formicerans, S. variable, B. faecis, B. obeum) were associated with reduction in peripheral pro-inflammatory responses including IFNγ, IFNα, IL6 JAK STAT3 signaling, and Inflammatory Response pathways. Conversely, increased abundances of E. coli and E. faecium were associated with inflammatory exacerbation, demonstrating that both pathogen clearance and microbiome composition independently predict treatment-induced changes in TB inflammatory response",hard,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_014,How did the study address the challenge of isolating microbiome effects from pathogen-killing effects?,"The study leveraged the unique properties of the NTZ treatment arm, which perturbed the microbiome without reducing Mtb bacterial load due to failure to penetrate sputum. This created a natural experimental control allowing dissociation of immunologic effects of pathogen killing from microbiota perturbation. By comparing three groups (HRZE with both effects, NTZ with only microbiome perturbation, and baseline), and using individual variability in responses within each arm, the researchers could train Random Forest models that explicitly accounted for both TTP changes and microbiome changes as independent predictors of inflammatory pathway expression. The validation in healthy controls further confirmed microbiome-inflammatory relationships independent of active infection",hard,mechanism
gi_microbiota_tb_015,What were the findings regarding IBD-associated genes during TB treatment?,"Out of 880 genes differentially expressed in IBD colon biopsies, 364 were detected in peripheral blood. HRZE administration changed 117 of these genes (FDR<0.05) with 66 renormalizing and 55 exacerbating. NTZ changed 55 genes (FDR<0.05) with 34 renormalizing and 21 exacerbating. These findings suggest that microbiome-related changes in peripheral inflammatory state are induced by both treatments, and despite HRZE's more limited microbiome effect compared to NTZ, it still affected a substantial number of IBD-associated inflammatory genes, indicating microbiome perturbations during TB therapy may have systemic inflammatory consequences",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_001,What percentage of TB patients in the study had positive sputum culture results?,"All enrolled TB patients (100%, 33/33) had positive sputum culture results. Additionally, 93.93% (31/33) showed lung pathological symptoms by chest x-rays, and 57.58% (19/33) were T-spot positive",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_002,How many participants were enrolled in the study and what were the two groups?,The study enrolled 53 participants total: 33 active tuberculosis (TB) patients and 20 healthy control (HC) subjects who were age- and sex-matched. All subjects belonged to the Han ethnic group and had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption,easy,factual
tb_microbiome_003,What sequencing methods were used to analyze gut bacteria and fungi?,"For gut bacterial analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used, specifically amplifying the V3-V4 hypervariable regions with primers 338F and 806R. For gut fungi analysis, ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer region 2) was amplified with primers ITS3F and ITS4R. Both were sequenced on the MiSeq PE300 platform",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_004,Which bacterial genera showed increased abundance in TB patients?,"At the genus level, Bacteroides and Prevotella showed significantly increased abundance in TB patients compared to healthy controls. Faecalibacterium also showed higher abundance in the TB group",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_005,Which bacterial genera showed decreased abundance in TB patients?,"The bacterial genera Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Eubacterium_hallii_group showed significantly decreased abundance in TB patients compared to healthy subjects",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_006,How did the fungal-to-bacterial species ratio change in TB patients?,"The fungal-to-bacterial species ratio (ITS/16S ratio based on observed Sobs indexes) was significantly decreased in TB patients compared to healthy controls. This indicates that the equilibrium between fungi and bacteria in the gut was altered in TB patients, with a relative reduction in fungal diversity",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_007,Describe the changes in alpha diversity for both bacteria and fungi in TB patients,"Both bacterial and fungal alpha diversity significantly decreased in TB patients. For bacteria, both Simpson and Chao 1 indexes were significantly lower in the TB group compared to HC. For fungi, the alpha diversity also showed decreased levels in TB patients, indicating reduced microbial richness and evenness in both kingdoms",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_008,How did the trans-kingdom network differ between TB patients and healthy controls?,"The trans-kingdom network in TB patients showed dramatically reduced complexity. In healthy controls, there were 193 nodes (99 fungi/94 bacteria) with 573 edges and higher centralization and density. In TB patients, there were only 153 nodes (82 fungi/71 bacteria) with 468 edges. The bacteria-fungi interaction ratio decreased from 12.57% to 10.04%, and negative correlations between bacteria and fungi were rare in TB patients",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_009,What changes occurred at the phylum level for gut bacteria in TB patients?,"At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was notably increased in TB patients, while Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were significantly decreased compared to healthy subjects. Firmicutes showed decreased levels in TB patients",medium,factual
tb_microbiome_010,Describe the alterations in gut mycobiota composition in TB patients,"At the phylum level, Ascomycota was the dominant phylum and its relative abundance notably increased in TB patients (84.89% vs. 68.46% in HC). At the genus level, Saccharomyces abundance increased dramatically to 53.67% in TB patients (from 14.28% in HC). Aspergillus, Cutaneotrichosporon, and Apiotrichum were substantially reduced in TB patients compared to healthy controls",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_011,How do serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 differ between TB patients and healthy controls?,"IFN-γ levels significantly decreased in TB patients compared to healthy controls, while IL-17 levels significantly increased in TB patients. This indicates a shift in the inflammatory cytokine profile, with reduced pro-inflammatory IFN-γ (important for controlling M.tb infection through macrophage activation) and elevated IL-17 (which can aggravate inflammation and enhance neutrophil recruitment)",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_012,Explain the correlation between Bacteroides and serum cytokines in TB patients,"Bacteroides, which was enriched in TB patients, showed a negative correlation with IFN-γ (r=-0.5958) and a positive correlation with IL-17 (r=0.5997). This suggests that increased Bacteroides abundance may contribute to suppressed IFN-γ production and elevated IL-17 levels. Bacteroides produce SCFAs that may enhance TB susceptibility by suppressing B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, ultimately reducing TB-induced IFN-γ production",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_013,What was the diagnostic performance of the combined bacterial and fungal biomarker set?,"A combined set of three bacterial genera (Bacteroides, Blautia, and Eubacterium_hallii_group) and three fungal genera (Apiotrichum, Penicillium, and Saccharomyces) showed remarkable diagnostic efficacy with an AUC of 0.996 (95% CI: 0.985-1.000). This was superior to using bacterial biomarkers alone (individual AUCs: 0.856, 0.821, 0.854) or fungal biomarkers alone (individual AUCs: 0.769, 0.804, 0.775)",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_014,Compare the role of Blautia in healthy controls versus its impact in TB patients,"Blautia showed raised levels in healthy controls and was positively correlated with IFN-γ (r=0.4413) and negatively correlated with IL-17 (r=-0.2742). Blautia has a strong ability to inhibit pro-inflammatory reactions by producing butyrate, which helps suppress IL-17. In TB patients, the reduced abundance of Blautia may contribute to decreased butyrate production, leading to higher IL-17 expression and reduced protective IFN-γ responses",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_015,Describe how the gut-lung axis theory relates to the findings in this TB study,"According to the gut-lung axis theory, gut microbiota plays a vital role in pulmonary infectious diseases like TB. This study demonstrated that TB patients have significant gut bacterial and fungal dysbiosis with decreased alpha diversity and altered composition. The dysbiosis correlates with altered immune cytokines (decreased IFN-γ, increased IL-17), suggesting that intestinal microbial changes can influence immune responses in the lungs. The altered gut microbiome may affect TB susceptibility and pathogenesis through modulation of systemic immunity",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_001,What are the major bacterial phyla that dominate the colonic microbiome?,"The colonic microbiome is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria from the major phyla of Firmicutes (predominantly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia)",easy,factual
gut_mech_002,How does the microbial abundance differ between the duodenum and the colon?,"Duodenal aspirates have microbial abundance 1000-fold lower than oral samples. The small intestine contains thousands to several hundred million cells per gram, while the colon contains up to 100 billion cells per gram of content",easy,factual
gut_mech_003,"What metabolites are produced when gut bacteria ferment dietary fibers, and what are their typical proportions?","Gut bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), primarily acetate, butyrate and propionate. These are typically found in a proportion of 1:1:3 (propionate:butyrate:acetate) in the GI tract",medium,factual
gut_mech_004,Explain how butyrate helps maintain anaerobic conditions in the colon and why this is important,"Butyrate maintains anaerobic conditions by activating beta-oxidation in colonocyte mitochondria, which consumes oxygen. It also activates PPARγ in colonic cells, which represses inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, reducing NO and nitrate production. This prevents facultative anaerobes like Enterobacteriaceae from proliferating, as increased nitrate availability favors pathogenic bacteria that can cause inflammation",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_005,"What are the two main G-protein-coupled receptors activated by short chain fatty acids, and what gut peptides do they stimulate?","The two main receptors are GPR43 (also called FFAR2) and GPR41 (also called FFAR3). They are expressed on enteroendocrine L-cells and stimulate the secretion of gut peptides including GLP-1, GLP-2 and PYY",medium,mechanism
gut_mech_006,What is metabolic endotoxemia and how does it relate to obesity?,"Metabolic endotoxemia is a state where high-fat diet and weight gain lead to increased gut permeability and subsequent systemic (mild) elevation in circulating plasma LPS. This causes low-grade inflammation, which is a pathological feature of chronic conditions including type 2 diabetes, NAFLD, chronic kidney disease and atherosclerosis",medium,mechanism
gut_mech_007,Describe the role of the endocannabinoid system in gut barrier function and obesity,"During obesity and diabetes, the intestinal endocannabinoid system is altered with increased abundance of anandamide (AEA) that triggers gut permeability via CB1-dependent mechanisms. This modification is associated with changes in gut microbiota. Pharmacological activation of the eCB system can increase adipogenesis and disrupt the gut barrier",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_008,"What are the primary and secondary bile acids, and how are they related?","Primary bile acids such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid are formed when gut microbes modify primary bile acids through deconjugation, dehydroxylation, oxidation or epimerization",medium,mechanism
gut_mech_009,What percentage of intestinal bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and what regulates their synthesis?,"Around 95% of intestinal bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver for re-secretion in the enterohepatic circulation. The losses in bile acids are compensated by de novo hepatic synthesis, which is regulated by fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) in humans (FGF15 in rodents) signaling in the small intestine",medium,factual
gut_mech_010,What is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and what role does it play in metabolic health?,"AhR is a transcription factor expressed ubiquitously that is activated by bacterial metabolites including tryptophan derivatives. It's linked to energy metabolism and metabolic syndrome. Studies show reduced capacity to metabolize tryptophan into AhR-binding derivatives in metabolic syndrome. Administration of Lactobacillus strains producing AhR ligands improved metabolic functions, ameliorated intestinal barrier, and reduced hepatic steatosis",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_011,Compare the microbiota and conditions of the small intestine versus the colon,"The small intestine has high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials with short transit time, containing thousands to several hundred million cells per gram with partly oxygen-tolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The colon has longer transit (over a dozen times longer), supports up to 100 billion cells per gram, and is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria including Firmicutes (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia",hard,comparison
gut_mech_012,What is the role of Akkermansia muciniphila's Amuc_1100 protein?,"Amuc_1100 is a 30 kDa outer membrane protein that signals to TLR2. It is thermostable, abundant in A. muciniphila proteomes, and has been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity in mouse models. It's suggested to be a pilus-associated protein with virtually no homology to bacteria outside the Verrucomicrobia",medium,mechanism
gut_mech_013,What are enterosynes and how do they relate to diabetes?,"Enterosynes are molecules originating from the gut which have the capacity to modulate duodenal contraction by targeting the enteric nervous system. In type 2 diabetes, duodenal hypermotility creates aberrant afferent nervous messages to the brain. Restoring natural duodenal contraction by acting on ENS neurons can restore the gut-brain axis and improve insulin sensitivity. For example, oligofructose increases 12-HETE which acts through mu-opioid receptors and PPARγ to improve glucose metabolism",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_014,How does NAPE-PLD deletion in different tissues affect metabolism and the gut microbiota?,"NAPE-PLD (N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing-specific phospholipase D) is a key endocannabinoid synthesis enzyme. Deletion in adipocytes causes spontaneous obesity, insulin resistance and microbiota shifts. Deletion in intestinal epithelial cells causes hyperphagia, exacerbated obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hypothalamic alterations. Deletion in hepatocytes causes high-fat diet-like phenotype on normal diet with changes in bile acids. All deletions profoundly affect gut microbiota composition",hard,mechanism
gut_mech_015,What are advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and how does the gut microbiota process them?,"AGEs are Maillard reaction products formed when free amino groups of proteins and amino acids react with reducing carbohydrates during thermal food processing. Fructoselysine, a primary dietary AGE formed from lysine and glucose, can be converted into butyrate by Intestinimonas species via a novel pathway. Another major AGE, N-ε-carboxymethyllysine, can be completely utilized by Cloacibacillus and potentially Oscillibacter species. AGEs are linked to type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer through pro-inflammatory responses",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_001,How many identifiable differential microbiomes were found in the gut between healthy controls and TB patients?,The study showed the presence of 26 identifiable differential microbiomes in the gut between healthy controls and the different time points in the development of TB in patients,easy,factual
tb_microbiome_002,What is China's ranking globally in terms of new TB cases?,"In 2021, China had approximately 780,000 new cases of TB, ranking second in the world, and is one of the 30 nations across the globe with a significant tuberculosis prevalence",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_003,How many participants were enrolled in this tuberculosis microbiome study and how were they grouped?,"Ninety participants were enrolled in this study, including initial TB patients (cz, n=30), retreated patients (fz, n=30), and healthy controls (jk, n=30). The participants in the three groups were paired based on their age, gender, and clinical symptoms",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_004,Which bacterial genera were most closely associated with the CD4/CD8 ratio?,"Five bacterial genera (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Collinsella, and Clostridium) were most closely associated with CD4/CD8 ratio",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_005,What percentage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections occur through the respiratory tract?,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis can invade various organs of the human body; however, 80% of infection is through the respiratory tract, primarily targeting the lungs, causing TB",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_006,Explain the mechanism by which Prevotella influences Th17 cell differentiation and immune responses,"When Prevotella is present in abundance, TLR2 is mainly triggered to secrete cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23, through antigen-presenting cells, thus prompting CD4+T to differentiate into Th17 cells. Prevotella also stimulates IL-6 and IL-8 production in epithelial cells and promotes mucosal Th17 immune responses and neutrophil aggregation",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_007,How does the gut-lung axis contribute to susceptibility to tuberculosis infection?,"The connection between intestinal microecology and lung diseases has been referred to as the 'gut-lung axis'. A balanced intestinal microecology can strengthen the body's resistance to acute and chronic respiratory infections caused by pathogenic bacteria. Studies have confirmed that mice with intestinal microbial interference are more likely to be infected with MTB, which affects their immune function",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_008,What role do short-chain fatty acids play in the lung-gut microbiome axis according to the paper?,"Studies have shown that the concentrations of propionate and butyrate in the intestine and blood are upregulated in lung disease models. Increased concentrations of propionate and butyrate stimulate the production of chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) in lung endothelial cells, which subsequently stimulates the influx of Th17 cells into the lungs via receptor 6",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_009,How do gut microbes influence the differentiation of specific T-cell subpopulations?,"Gut microbes have an important influence on the host's immune response by regulating effector T cells in the gut. Studies have shown that certain gut microbes can promote the differentiation of specific T-cell subpopulations. Bacteroides and Clostridium can induce the differentiation of Treg cells, Bordetella pertussis can promote the maturation of Th1 cells in the gut, and Segmented Filamentous Bacteria, Citrobacter Rodentium, and E.coli can induce the differentiation of Th17 cells in the mouse intestine",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_010,Describe the changes in alpha diversity indices between healthy controls and TB patients,"The healthy control group exhibited a moderate increase in all alpha diversity indices compared to the patients in the recurrent TB group. The Chao1-diversity, Shannon diversity, Pielou_e-index, and Observed_species-index were significantly increased in the different periods of TB groups compared to controls, indicating that TB had an impact on the microbiota diversity",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_011,What was the performance of the biomarker model in distinguishing TB patients from healthy controls?,"Twenty genera were used as microbiome markers to distinguish patients in different periods of TB from healthy controls. Using this model, they accurately differentiated patients from healthy controls with the area beneath the ROC curve measured to be 0.807 for the cz group and 0.715 for the fz group",medium,factual
tb_microbiome_012,"Compare the CD4+ T cell levels, CD8+ T cell levels, and CD4/CD8 ratios between the three groups studied","The retreatment group showed a marked reduction in the amount of CD4+ cells when compared to both the initial treatment and control groups. The two TB groups had a greater proportion of CD8+ and NKT cells than the control group, while the CD4/CD8 ratio was substantially inferior to that of the control group. This indicates that patients with pulmonary TB had immune dysfunction, particularly in the retreatment group",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_013,Explain the dual and controversial role of IL-4 in pulmonary tuberculosis pathogenesis,"The immune role of IL-4 in pulmonary TB remains controversial. The creation of IL-4 by Th2 cells primarily facilitates the differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. On the one hand, it positively regulates the anti-TB response; on the other hand, as an anti-inflammatory factor, IL-4 can induce macrophages to accelerate apoptosis when the disease is severe, leading to pathogenic damage. The study results favor the latter interpretation, with IL-4 selectively controlling antigen presentation to inhibit Th1 cell function, maintain Th2 cell proliferation, cause immune damage, and even form cavitary lesions of TB",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_014,"Compare the cytokine profiles (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-2) across the three study groups and explain their clinical significance","The amount of IL-4 in the two TB cohorts was notably reduced, and the amount of IL-6 was notably greater than that of the control group. The initial treatment group experienced a substantial rise in IL-10 levels, while the retreatment group witnessed a significant increase in IL-2 levels. The IL-6 increase in the retreatment group suggests disease severity correlation. The IL-10 increase in early TB indicates it inhibited rapid MTB replication and played a protective role. Low IL-2 suggests insufficient secretion prevented the body from completely clearing MTB, leading to active TB or relapse",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_015,Describe the unique microbial signatures found in initial TB patients versus retreated TB patients,"The initial TB patient group showed a unique microbiota with a higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae, Gemmiger, Eubacterium, Actinomycetaceae, Actinomyces, TM7, TM7_3, Bulleidia, Comamonas, Coxiellaceae, Rickettsiella, Legionellales, and Gaiella. In contrast, Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacteriales, Clostridium, and Acidaminococcus were mainly concentrated in the intestines of retreated patients, indicating distinct microbial profiles at different disease stages",hard,comparison
mdr_tb_microbiome_001,How many participants were recruited in the study and what were the four groups?,"A total of 76 participants were recruited at a hospital in Linyi, China. The study included four groups: a MDR-TB treated group (n=6), a MDR-TB recovered group (n=18), and two treatment-naive tuberculosis control groups (untreated group 1 with n=24 and untreated group 2 with n=28). The two untreated groups were constructed to match the sex and age of the treated and recovered groups respectively",easy,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_002,How long had the MDR-TB recovered group been off treatment?,The MDR-TB recovered group had discontinued treatment for 3-8 years. They had previously been under MDR-TB treatment for 2-5 years before stopping the treatment,easy,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_003,What is the typical duration of MDR-TB treatment and which drugs are commonly used?,"MDR-TB treatment lasts for at least 20 months and consists of a variety of antibiotics. The treatment includes an 8-month intensive phase with one injection drug (kanamycin, amikacin, or capreomycin) and four oral drugs from first-line drugs, fluoroquinolones, and second-line oral bacteriostatic drugs. Then the administration of four oral drugs continues for another 12 months",easy,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_004,What percentage decrease in gut microbiota richness was observed in the recovered group?,"The MDR-TB recovered group exhibited a 16% decrease in gut microbiota richness (measured by ACE) compared to the untreated control group (p=0.018), even 3-8 years after discontinuing treatment",easy,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_005,What gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in the recovered group?,"Although there were persistent and pervasive gut microbiota alterations, no gastrointestinal symptom such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, and constipation was observed in the recovered group",easy,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_006,"Describe the changes in alpha diversity metrics (ACE, Shannon index, and Shannon evenness) in the recovered group","In the recovered group compared to untreated controls: ACE (richness) significantly decreased (p=0.018), indicating reduced species richness. Shannon index (diversity) significantly increased (p=0.004), suggesting altered community structure. Shannon evenness significantly increased (p<0.001), indicating more even distribution of species. This pattern shows decreased richness but more even distribution among remaining species",medium,mechanism
mdr_tb_microbiome_007,How did the gut microbiota composition change at the phylum level during and after MDR-TB treatment?,"During MDR-TB treatment, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes declined significantly (p=0.009 and p=0.029 respectively), while Bacteroidetes increased (p=0.038). After recovery, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes rebounded to pre-treatment levels, but Bacteroidetes remained elevated (p=0.029). Additionally, Cyanobacteria and Patescibacteria showed no response during treatment but significantly decreased after recovery (p<0.001 for both)",medium,mechanism
mdr_tb_microbiome_008,What metabolic changes were observed in the recovered group and were they statistically significant?,"The recovered group exhibited significantly elevated lipid levels: LDLC increased to 2.7 mmol/L compared to 2.2 mmol/L in controls (p=0.034), and TC increased to 4.7 mmol/L compared to 4.2 mmol/L in controls (p=0.017). No significant differences were observed for HDLC, TG, or FPG. Liver function markers (ALT, AST, AST/ALT) were within normal range, indicating the altered lipid profile was not caused by liver damage",medium,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_009,How many bacterial genera biomarkers were identified in the treated group versus the recovered group?,"In the MDR-TB treated group, 17 bacterial genera were identified as biomarkers (LDA>2), with 16 showing decreased abundance. In the MDR-TB recovered group, 58 biomarkers (LDA>2) were identified compared to untreated controls, with 28 decreased and 30 increased in abundance",medium,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_010,What were the PERMANOVA p-values for comparing gut microbiota communities between groups?,Based on unweighted UniFrac distance: the p-value between MDR-TB treated group and untreated group 1 was 0.003; between MDR-TB recovered group and untreated group 2 was 0.001; between the two untreated groups was 0.520 (no separation). Based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity: p-value between recovered group and untreated group 2 was 0.001; between treated group and untreated group 1 was 0.141 (no separation); between two untreated groups was 0.826,medium,factual
mdr_tb_microbiome_011,Explain the correlation between Verrucomicrobia/Akkermansia and LDLC levels,"The LDLC level was negatively associated with Verrucomicrobia (r=-0.437, p=0.006) and its genus Akkermansia (r=-0.437, p=0.006). This means that as the abundance of these bacteria decreased, LDLC levels increased. This correlation suggests that Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia may have protective effects against elevated cholesterol, and their reduction after MDR-TB treatment may contribute to adverse lipid profiles",hard,mechanism
mdr_tb_microbiome_012,Describe the mechanisms by which altered gut microbiota may lead to elevated LDLC and TC levels,"Several mechanisms explain this correlation: (1) Bile acid metabolism - Firmicutes convert bile acids to secondary bile acids that improve liver function and metabolic homeostasis; reduced Firmicutes decreases this beneficial conversion. (2) Short-chain fatty acid production - Coprococcus produces butyrate that modulates lipid metabolism; its decrease correlates with increased TC. (3) Trimethylamine production - bacteria like Prevotellaceae produce TMA from dietary choline/L-carnitine, which is metabolized to TMAO that inhibits reverse cholesterol transport and increases LDLC. The study found positive correlation between Prevotellaceae and LDLC",hard,mechanism
mdr_tb_microbiome_013,Compare the recovery of gut microbiota after short-course versus long-course antibiotic treatment based on the literature discussed,"For short-course single antibiotic treatment (5-day ciprofloxacin), the taxonomic composition was not distinguishable from untreated groups after 4-week recovery, and richness rebounded to pre-treatment levels. For high antibiotic exposure (6-month TB treatment with combination therapy), altered microbiota community was observed 1.2 years after cessation, though richness recovered. However, MDR-TB treatment (20+ months with multiple antibiotics) resulted in irreversible changes: 16% decreased richness and dramatically altered composition persisting 3-8 years after treatment cessation. The degree of recovery inversely correlates with treatment intensity and duration",hard,comparison
mdr_tb_microbiome_014,"According to resilience theory, why did the gut microbiota not return to its original state after MDR-TB treatment?","According to resilience theory, gut microbiota as an ecosystem can return to its original equilibrium or achieve a new equilibrium after disturbance cessation, depending on the strength of the disturbance and the stability of the microbiota. The MDR-TB treatment represents an unprecedented disturbance - none of the previously studied antibiotic treatments has comparable impact. The new equilibrium is driven by both direct effects (elimination of certain bacterial species by antibiotics) and indirect effects (loss of autotrophic bacteria that rely on fermentation products of eliminated bacteria, or competitive bacteria that previously competed with eliminated bacteria). The network analysis also suggested close correlations among bacterial genera, meaning elimination of some species affects others",hard,mechanism
mdr_tb_microbiome_015,What bacterial taxa showed correlations with total cholesterol (TC) levels in the study?,"TC was negatively associated with: Firmicutes (r=-0.35, p=0.032), Butyricicoccus (r=-0.369, p=0.023), Coprococcus 1 (r=-0.409, p=0.011), Erysipelatoclostridium (r=-0.403, p=0.012), Psychrobacter (r=-0.332, p=0.042), and Streptococcus (r=-0.420, p=0.009). TC was positively associated with: Fusicatenibacter (r=0.381, p=0.018), Klebsiella (r=0.339, p=0.038), Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group (r=0.364, p=0.025), Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group (r=0.371, p=0.022), and Lachnospiraceae UCG001 group (r=0.327, p=0.045)",hard,factual
mali_tb_001,How many TB participants were included in the final analysis and how many completed the study at Month-15?,"A total of 155 TB patients were enrolled in the longitudinal cohort study. However, only 30 TB participants who were infected with Mtb complex strains confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic identification methods were included in the final analysis. Of these, 23 (76.6%) completed the study at Month-15",easy,factual
mali_tb_002,What was the first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment regimen used in this study?,"The first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment regimen comprised two months of isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E), followed by four months of rifampin (R) and isoniazid (H), denoted as 2HRZE/4RH",easy,factual
mali_tb_003,How many times higher are treated TB patients at risk of experiencing a new TB episode compared to the general population?,Treated and cured individuals are at least 8 times more likely to experience a new episode of TB disease than the general population,easy,factual
mali_tb_004,What were the four time points at which TB patients were sampled in this longitudinal study?,"TB participants had four study visits for clinical investigation and sample collection: before TB treatment initiation (TB_M0), two months (TB_M2), and six months (TB_M6) during anti-tuberculosis therapy, and then nine months after treatment completion (TB_M15)",easy,factual
mali_tb_005,How many metabolites were found to be statistically significant across the three TB time points studied?,"Using ANOVA with repeated measures, 470 metabolites were found to be statistically significant across the three groups (TB_M0, TB_M6, and TB_M15) with FDR<0.1",easy,factual
mali_tb_006,Explain how the Shannon diversity of gut microbiota changed over the course of TB treatment,"Shannon diversity increased in patients' gut microbiota over time. TB_M0 and TB_M2 were significantly different from healthy controls, while TB_M6 and TB_M15 showed no significant difference from healthy controls according to TukeyHSD ANOVA analysis. This indicates that microbial diversity gradually recovered during and after treatment",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_007,Describe the changes observed in the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria during TB treatment,"At the phylum level, Firmicutes increased significantly with time after treatment, while Proteobacteria decreased significantly. These changes were determined using linear mixed effect models with FDR<0.1",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_008,What role does quinolinate play in TB treatment and how is it related to gut microbiota?,"Quinolinate (quinolinic acid) is a marker for kynurenine in the tryptophan pathway. The study found a negative correlation between the genus Actinosynnema, Megasphaera, and Roseburia relative abundances and the quinolinate metabolite. Antibiotics during TB treatment, mainly pyrazinamide and isoniazid, disturb the metabolic pathways of quinolinic acid, and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio is a great biomarker for pulmonary tuberculosis",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_009,How does arachidonic acid relate to TB pathogenesis and gut microbiota dysbiosis?,"Arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, negatively correlates with the abundance of Actinosynnema. This acid is used by Mtb via biosynthesis in infected macrophages, which impairs their inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Its persistence nine months after TB treatment may explain the higher vulnerability of cured TB patients to new TB episodes",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_010,What changes were observed in the Euryarchaeota phylum during TB treatment?,"Euryarchaeota, one of the two major known archaeal phyla, decreased from the gut microbiota of TB_M0 and at TB_M2 (during isoniazid and rifampicin regimen), then the level increased at TB_M6 before being finally decreased again at TB_M15. This demonstrates that TB treatment affects not only bacteria but also archaea in the gut",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_011,Describe the functional pathway changes observed in TB patients compared to healthy controls,"In TB patients, 75 pathways increased with time and 11 decreased with time using linear mixed effect models (FDR<0.1). Compared with healthy controls, 11 pathways were less abundant at TB_M0 and 212 pathways were more abundant. Among these pathways, four were still less abundant and 15 were still more abundant at TB_M2. None of these pathways were significantly different between TB_M6 and controls, while three became significantly more abundant at TB_M15 again",medium,mechanism
mali_tb_012,"Compare the cytokine profiles observed during TB treatment, specifically IL-6, IFN-γ, and IL-17A","IL-6 and IFN-γ were the most significantly higher levels of cytokines, which play an important role in the acute phase response against Mtb. During TB treatment, their levels decreased before total bacterial clearance, predicting positive TB treatment outcomes. In contrast, IL-17A, known to have a strong link with the gut, was highly expressed during the treatment period, and the trend was maintained a long time after completion at TB-M15",hard,comparison
mali_tb_013,Explain the relationship between the modern Euro-American lineage 4 Mtb strains and treatment response compared to other lineages,"A total of 19/30 (63.33%) of the TB patients were infected with the modern Euro-American lineage 4, which showed a high amount of persistence of sputum smear positivity at month-2 of TB treatment at 10/13 (76.92%). The other circulating lineages in Mali (lineage 1, lineage 2, and lineage 3) were more responsive to the anti-TB drugs, with 8/11 (72.72%) clearing at this time point, indicating that strain lineage affects treatment response",hard,comparison
mali_tb_014,Compare the metabolomic profiles at different time points using PCA and HCA analyses,"Principal Components Analysis (PCA) plots showed that TB_M0 is distinct and separated from TB_M6 and TB_M15, indicating that the treatment effects on metabolites were maintained at least nine months after treatment completion. The overlap between TB_M6 and TB_M15 suggests their metabolic profiles are similar and different from the pre-treatment/infection stage. Using Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA), five groupings of 15 subjects' samples were found, with a cluster of nine pre-treatment samples suggesting good similarities among pre-treatment samples",hard,comparison
mali_tb_015,Describe the comprehensive metabolic pathway correlations found with both taxa abundance and metabolites in TB patients,"The study found significant correlations between genus/pathway and metabolite abundance. Taxa correlated with metabolite production belong to bacteria phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota from archaea. Fatty acids like quinolinate and arachidonate levels decreased with increased taxa. Negative correlation was found between quinolinate and both Guanosine and methylerythritol phosphate pathway I. Ornithine negatively correlated with glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and glyoxylate bypass. Citrulline and kynurenate positively correlated with histidine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthesis, aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, and starch degradation V pathway",hard,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_001,What were the alpha diversity indexes showing in PTB patients compared to healthy controls?,"The alpha diversity indexes of the PTB patients were significantly lower than the healthy controls (P<0.05). Specifically, Shannon (P<0.01), Simpson (P<0.05), Chao1 (P<0.001), and ACE (P<0.001) indexes all showed that the diversity of fecal microbiota in PTB patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls",easy,factual
ptb_microbiome_002,Which bacterial genera showed increased abundance in PTB patients at the genus level?,"At the genus level, PTB patients had significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (25.59% vs. 16.14%, P<0.05), Parabacteroides (2.88% vs. 0.90%, P<0.05), and Veillonella (4.24% vs. 0.84%, P<0.05) compared with healthy controls",easy,factual
ptb_microbiome_003,How many participants were enrolled in the study and what were their demographics?,"A total of 69 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 63 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled from the Affiliated Dongyang Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from May 2021 to June 2022. Among them, 40 (63.49%) healthy controls and 44 (63.77%) PTB patients were men, with average ages of 49 and 51 years respectively",easy,factual
ptb_microbiome_004,What sequencing method was used and which region of the bacterial genome was analyzed?,"16S rRNA gene sequencing was used, specifically targeting the V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The samples were amplified using 515F and 806R primers and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform",easy,factual
ptb_microbiome_005,Which SCFA-producing bacteria were depleted in PTB patients?,"PTB patients showed a significant decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera including Faecalibacterium (5.31% vs. 14.80%, P<0.05), Bifidobacterium (1.67% vs. 5.02%, P<0.05), Agathobacter (0.86% vs. 3.32%, P<0.05), and CAG-352 (0.60% vs. 2.21%, P<0.05) compared to healthy controls",easy,factual
ptb_microbiome_006,How does the gut microbiota imbalance affect biochemical indexes in PTB patients through lipopolysaccharide production?,"PTB patients showed an enrichment of Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteriota, many of which produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway was significantly up-regulated in the PTB group. Chronic infection and persistent inflammatory reaction of tuberculosis may affect the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, facilitating bacterial translocation and leading to increased circulating LPS. This LPS can induce insulin resistance and is related to hyperglycemia, which helps explain the high blood glucose level and low blood lipid level observed in PTB patients",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_007,Explain the relationship between SCFA-producing bacteria and clinical biochemical markers in the study,"SCFA-producing bacteria enriched in healthy controls (such as Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_group, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Dorea, and Butyricicoccus) were positively correlated with lipid levels (TC, TG, HDL, LDL), Albumin, and Hemoglobin. Particularly, Albumin was positively correlated with SCFA producers including Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Faecalibacterium, Dorea, Butyricicoccus, and Bifidobacterium (P<0.001). This indicates that the enrichment of probiotics in the intestine is closely related to the healthy physiological state of the host",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_008,How do SCFAs benefit human health according to the study's discussion?,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are key mediators of beneficial effects from the gut microbiome. SCFAs can inhibit inflammation and regulate basic metabolism. They directly modulate host metabolic health related to appetite regulation, energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis, and immunomodulation. The study suggests that the reduction of SCFA-producing bacteria in PTB patients contributes to imbalance of intestinal flora structure and function, leading to pathological metabolism",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_009,What metabolic pathways were significantly altered in PTB patients according to PICRUSt2 analysis?,"PTB patients showed significant increases in 7 biosynthesis pathways related to ubiquinone, polyketide, siderophore, folate, lipopolysaccharide, N-glycan, and steroid hormone. Five metabolism pathways related to lipoic acid, ascorbate, taurine, fructose, and biotin were strikingly increased. The degradation capacities for amino acid and glycan were increased in patients. PTB patients had more pathways involved in toxin degradation and energy circulation, specifically reflected in the rise of peroxisome and TCA cycle pathways",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_010,What role does Lactobacillus enrichment play in PTB pathogenesis?,"Lactobacillus was significantly increased in PTB patients and was one of the significantly enriched taxa according to LEfSe analysis. Previous studies found that Lactobacillus was significantly increased in newly treated patients with PTB, and lactate, the product of Lactobacillus, was found to provide additional carbon matrix for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Additionally, Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with lipid levels (TG, Hb, LDL, TC) and Albumin in the study",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_011,Describe the folic acid biosynthesis pathway alteration and its relationship to Lactobacillus in PTB patients,"The biosynthesis of folic acid increased significantly in PTB patients according to PICRUSt2 analysis. This might be due to the enrichment of Lactobacillus in the PTB group, which is known as folic acid-producing bacteria. This represents one of the metabolic pathway changes that distinguishes PTB patients from healthy controls and demonstrates the functional impact of altered microbiota composition",medium,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_012,Compare the phylum-level microbiota composition changes between PTB patients and healthy controls,"At the phylum level, PTB patients showed an enrichment of Bacteroidota (33.10% vs. 27.08%), Proteobacteria (12.99% vs. 9.83%), and Fusobacteriota (0.58% vs. 0.56%, P<0.05), while displaying a remarkable decrease of Firmicutes (48.07% vs. 55.89%, P<0.05) and Actinobacteriota (2.44% vs. 5.83%, P<0.01) compared with healthy controls. This shift represents a fundamental change in gut microbiota architecture",hard,comparison
ptb_microbiome_013,What diagnostic biomarker combination was identified for PTB and what was its performance?,"A random forest model was constructed using 30 genus markers. Six genera were identified as having the best combined diagnostic ability: Lactobacillus (AUC=0.758), Faecalibacterium (AUC=0.803), Roseburia (AUC=0.829), Dorea (AUC=0.851), Monnoglobus (AUC=0.867), and [Eubacterium]_ventriosum_group (AUC=0.88). The model including all six genera had a diagnostic ability of AUC=0.90, which is better than the overall 30 genera model (AUC=0.91), indicating this combination might be a set of new diagnostic biomarkers for PTB with improved accuracy and reduced complexity",hard,factual
ptb_microbiome_014,"How does the microbial interaction network differ between PTB patients and healthy controls, and what does this suggest?","Based on the relative abundance of OTUs, PTB patients showed a more complex network of interactions than healthy controls, with more positive and negative correlations among the microbiota. This increased complexity in microbial interactions suggests that the PTB-associated dysbiosis involves not just changes in individual taxa abundances, but alterations in the dynamic interactions between community members, which may contribute to the destabilization of the gut ecosystem",hard,mechanism
ptb_microbiome_015,Explain the proposed mechanism by which gut microbiota dysbiosis affects PTB pathology through the gut-lung axis and nutrient metabolism,"The study hypothesizes that changes in gut microbiota exert an impact on PTB clinical characteristics through the gut-lung axis by regulating the nutrient utilization pathway. PTB patients showed enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria and reduction of SCFA-producing probiotics, causing imbalance in intestinal flora structure and function. This dysbiosis led to pathological metabolism in the PTB group, with significantly increased metabolism/degradation pathways of amino acids and glycan indicating an increased basal metabolic rate consistent with low fever pathology of PTB. The upregulation of these pathways resulted from complicated microbial interaction networks demanding more nutrients. Additionally, increased LPS production from anaerobic bacteria facilitated by compromised intestinal barrier integrity further aggravated host inflammation, connecting microbiota changes to the clinical manifestations of malnutrition, altered lipid metabolism, and hyperglycemia in PTB patients",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_001,How many samples were used in the initial training dataset and testing dataset?,"The study first sequenced the metagenomes of 61 fecal samples from 31 healthy controls (C group) and 30 TB patients (P group) for the training dataset. Another 16 patients were sequenced and used as the patient group (Test-P) in the testing dataset. For validation, 30 healthy controls (Test-H group) were randomly selected from a type 2 diabetes cohort study",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_002,"What taxonomic profiling tool was used and how many phyla, genera, and species were identified?","MetaPhlAn2 was used for taxonomic profiling. Using this tool, the researchers identified 11 phyla, 156 genera, and 400 species across the three groups",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_003,Which two species were enriched in TB patients compared to healthy controls?,"Only two species were found enriched in TB patients: an unclassified Coprobacillus bacterium and Clostridium bolteae. Notably, C. bolteae is a frequently reported autism-associated bacterium that has also been found enriched in type 2 diabetes patients",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_004,What sequencing platform and insert size were used for library construction?,"DNA sequencing libraries with insert sizes of 350 bp were constructed following Illumina manufacturer's instructions. The libraries were then paired-end sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 Illumina sequencers, obtaining approximately 5 GB of clean data for each sample on average",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_005,How many SCFA-producing bacteria were enriched in healthy controls and what types were they?,"Nine out of the 23 control-enriched bacteria were widely reported SCFA-producing bacteria, including five butyrate producers (Roseburia inulinivorans, R. hominis, R. intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, and Coprococcus comes), two lactate and acetate producers (Bifidobacterium adolescentis and B. longum), and two acetate and propionate producers (Ruminococcus obeum and Akkermansia muciniphila)",easy,factual
tb_microbiome_006,Explain the gut-lung axis hypothesis and its bidirectional mechanisms,"The gut-lung axis hypothesis suggests dynamic cross talk between the microbiota of the respiratory tract and the gut. The processes are bidirectional, occurring either via the translocation of local bacteria to the other site or through the release of immunomodulatory molecules (bacteria-derived components or metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs]) into the bloodstream, thus affecting systemic immunity",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_007,What were the findings regarding metabolic pathway alterations in TB patients?,"In total, 110 metabolic pathways were found differentially enriched between the controls and patients (FDR<0.1), with 87 over-represented in healthy controls and only 23 enriched in patients, suggesting an overall decrease in metabolic potentials in TB patients. One hundred and six of these pathways belonged to three categories: Biosynthesis, Degradation/Utilization/Assimilation, and Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy. Notably, five pathways related to SCFA fermentation were strikingly decreased in TB patients",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_008,Describe the vitamin biosynthesis pathway differences between TB patients and healthy controls,"Six vitamin biosynthesis pathways related to folate, pantothenate, vitamin B6, thiamine, and flavin biosynthesis were highly represented in TB patients, while only the biotin and ascorbate biosynthetic pathways were more abundant in healthy controls. This represents an interesting reversal where patients showed higher capacity for certain vitamin biosynthesis pathways",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_009,How do SCFAs affect host inflammatory and immune responses according to the study?,"SCFAs exert remarkable effects on host inflammatory and immune responses. The decreased abundance of SCFA-producers has been observed in patients with inflammation-associated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes. The loss of SCFA producers and associated pathways in TB patients may indicate elevated systemic inflammation and impairment of the systemic immune response",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_010,What is the significance of Clostridium bolteae enrichment in TB patients in relation to other diseases?,"Clostridium bolteae is a frequently reported autism-associated bacterium that has also been found enriched in type 2 diabetes patients. Interestingly, both autism and T2D are closely connected with immune system abnormalities, and M. tuberculosis infections demonstrate strong interactions with the human immune system. A causal link between mycobacterial infection and autism has been proposed, while an increased risk for M. tuberculosis infection in T2D patients has been recognized for centuries. This suggests there may be a shared alteration in immune signals that induces the similarly observed enrichment of C. bolteae across these conditions",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_011,Explain the conflicting evidence regarding SCFAs and tuberculosis risk,"While the study found decreased SCFA-producing bacteria in TB patients suggesting potential benefits of SCFAs, there is conflicting evidence. Increased SCFAs in the lungs of HIV patients after antiretroviral therapy has been suggested to increase TB risk by suppressing IFN-γ and IL-17A production. This paradox indicates that the role of SCFAs and the causality between active TB and the decrease of SCFA-producing bacteria should be further defined",medium,mechanism
tb_microbiome_012,Compare the species number and alpha diversity between TB patients and healthy controls with statistical significance,"The number of species present in TB patients was significantly decreased compared to healthy controls (P = 1.95E-5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Consistently, the Shannon index indicating within-sample (α) diversity was much lower for the patient groups than for the controls (P = 2.84E-4; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This demonstrates a dramatic reduction in both species richness and diversity in TB patients",hard,comparison
tb_microbiome_013,What was the performance of the random forest classification model in both training and testing datasets?,"The random forest model using three species markers (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Roseburia inulinivorans, and R. hominis) achieved an AUC of 84.6% with a 95% confidence interval of 0.651-0.956 in the training set (n=31 controls and 30 patients). When validated on an independent test set consisting of 16 patients and 30 healthy controls, the model performed well with an AUC of 0.767 and a 95% CI of 0.614-0.920",hard,factual
tb_microbiome_014,Describe the SNP analysis findings in Bacteroides vulgatus and their implications,"Among six species selected for SNP distribution analysis, B. vulgatus was the most prevalent, presenting in 70 samples. Forty-six SNPs in B. vulgatus were differentially distributed between the two groups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that control samples could be largely clustered together and separated from patient samples, suggesting distinct mutation patterns between groups. Eight SNPs were located in seven carbohydrate metabolism genes including those encoding β-galactosidase, α-N-arabinofuranosidase, α-1,2-mannosidase, rhamnulokinase, Rhamnogalacturonides degradation protein, β-galactosidase, and D-lactate dehydrogenase. This suggests an altered carbohydrate preference and different carbohydrate metabolism patterns in the gut bacteria of TB patients",hard,mechanism
tb_microbiome_015,What are the limitations and future directions mentioned in the study regarding causality and diagnostic potential?,"The study found significant dysbiosis of gut microbiota in TB patients, but the causal relationship remains to be determined. While it's likely these changes were caused by M. tuberculosis infection based on similar results in murine models, the possibility that dysbiosis precedes and contributes to infection cannot be excluded. Additionally, as only TB patients and healthy controls were included, it's unclear if the gut bacteria and suggested model can discriminate TB patients from other non-TB patients. To be a potential diagnostic method, the accuracy and specificity should be validated in large-scale sampling studies. Finally, the findings were observed in active TB infection; the gut microbiota signature in latent TB infection still needs investigation",hard,mechanism
crc_microbiome_001,How many stool metagenomes were analyzed in total across all cohorts in this study?,"The study analyzed 3,741 stool metagenomes from 18 cohorts across 11 countries, including 1,471 CRC samples, 702 adenoma samples, and 1,568 control samples",easy,factual
crc_microbiome_002,What was the average AUC achieved for CRC prediction using the LODO approach?,"The LODO (leave-one-dataset-out) approach achieved an average AUC of 0.85, ranging from 0.71 to 0.97, which was an improvement over previous studies that achieved an average LODO AUC of 0.81",easy,factual
crc_microbiome_003,How many new cohorts were sequenced specifically for this study?,"Six new cohorts were sequenced for this study, providing 1,625 new stool metagenomes. Four cohorts were part of the ONCOBIOME initiative, one was from the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), and one was from Turkey",easy,factual
crc_microbiome_004,What profiling tools were used to analyze the metagenomic samples?,"MetaPhlAn 4 was used for taxonomic profiling, HUMAnN 3.6 for functional profiling, and StrainPhlAn 4 for dominant strain profiling at single-nucleotide resolution",easy,factual
crc_microbiome_005,How many bacterial species-level genome bins (SGBs) were detected in total?,"A total of 3,866 bacterial SGBs, 15 eukaryotic SGBs, and 23 archaeal SGBs were detected across all samples",easy,factual
crc_microbiome_006,"How does the oral-to-gut microbiome score differ between CRC patients and controls, and what does this indicate?","The oral-to-gut microbiome score was significantly higher in CRC cases (Hedges' SMD = 0.47, P < 0.001) and increased further in later CRC stages (Hedges' SMD = 0.14, P = 0.003). Right-sided CRC showed higher presence of orally derived SGBs compared to left-sided CRC (Hedges' SMD = -0.23, P = 0.003), indicating that oral bacterial infiltration into the gut is a key differentiator of CRC stages and locations",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_007,"What role does the gut microbiome play in ammonia production in CRC, and which enzymes are involved?","The gut microbiome contributes to increased ammonia levels in CRC through L-histidine degradation pathways (SMD = 0.41 and 0.32, q < 0.1). The enzyme histidase (EC 4.3.1.3) cleaves L-histidine to produce urocanate and ammonia, and was enriched in CRC (SMD = 0.46, q < 0.1), late CRC (SMD = 0.18, P = 0.02), and metastatic CRC (SMD = 0.35, q < 0.1). Methylaspartate ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) was also highly associated with CRC (SMD = 0.45, q < 0.1)",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_008,Describe the relationship between the primary tumor presence and the stool microbiome signature in stage IV CRC patients,"In the AtezoTRIBE study of stage IV CRC patients, those with in situ primary tumors showed significantly different microbiome profiles compared to those with resected tumors (LODO AUC = 0.78). Thirteen of the 20 top CRC-associated SGBs (11 oral species) were significantly more abundant when the primary tumor was present (P < 0.05), confirming that the primary tumor microenvironment determines the overall stool microbiome signature in CRC",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_009,How did the study identify and characterize strain-level associations with CRC?,"The study used StrainPhlAn 4 for dominant strain profiling at single-nucleotide resolution and Anpan for gene carriage analysis. They identified 62 species with differential gene carriage (GLM FDR q < 0.05, absolute coefficient > 1) and 8 species with differential strain phylogenies in CRC (ELPD > 4). The analysis revealed that strain-level differentiation often occurred independently of species-level abundance changes, with 27 species showing phylogenetic associations specifically with metastatic CRC",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_010,What patterns of microbial succession were observed along the adenoma-carcinoma sequence?,"The microbiome changes occurred predominantly on a continuum rather than discrete stages. Parvimonas micra SGB6653 and Fusobacterium nucleatum SGB6007 showed increasing abundance starting from stage I. Seventeen SGBs were associated with late CRC versus only four with early CRC. Five oral-typical species (Slackia exigua, P. micra, Solobacterium, Dialister pneumosintes, and Streptococcus mutans) were significantly increased in late CRC. The microbiome of adenoma patients did not differ significantly from controls, suggesting the gut microbiome plays a more crucial role in the adenoma-carcinoma transition",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_011,How do sulfur-producing enzymes and oleate production pathways relate to CRC?,"Sulfur-producing enzymes were significantly associated with CRC, including homocysteine desulfhydrase (EC 4.4.1.2, SMD = 0.52, q < 0.001) and protein disulfide reductase (EC 1.8.1.8, SMD = 0.41, q < 0.001). Two pathways involved in oleate production in aerobes (PWY-6282, SMD = 0.4 and PWY-7664, SMD = 0.9, both q < 0.1) were also associated with CRC, supporting the hypothesis that oleate is linked to proliferation of cancerous cells",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiome_012,"Compare the microbial signatures and their overlap between different CRC stages, cardiometabolic risk markers, and inflammatory diseases","All CRC stages shared approximately 25% of species associated with cardiometabolic risk from the PREDICT 1 study. Stage 0 CRC had the highest proportion of oral bacteria (58%), while stage I showed the highest percentage of species common with poor cardiometabolic health (27%). All CRC stages shared SGBs with Crohn's disease and immune-mediated diseases, while stage IV shared 21% with poor cardiometabolic health markers. Importantly, only two SGBs (Hungatella hathewayi SGB4741 and Enterocloster aldensis SGB476) were common across cardiometabolic risk, inflammatory diseases, and CRC, indicating distinct yet partially overlapping microbial signatures",hard,comparison
crc_microbiome_013,Explain the subspecies-level differentiation observed in Fusobacterium nucleatum and how different clades associate with CRC,"Five distinct F. nucleatum SGBs were identified with varying associations to CRC: SGB6007 (F. nucleatum animalis/Fna C2, SMD = 0.54), SGB6014 (F. nucleatum vincentii, SMD = 0.5), SGB6011 (F. nucleatum subsp. nucleatum/sensu stricto, SMD = 0.47), SGB6001 (F. nucleatum polymorphum, SMD = 0.43), and SGB6013 (Fna C1, SMD = 0.34), all q < 0.1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed subclades within these SGBs with differential prevalence in oral cavity versus gut environments. PhyloPhlAn 3 reconstruction showed F. nucleatum SGB6007 exhibited greater than 8 ELPD improvement in the phylogenetic model, indicating genomic adaptation to the intestinal environment beyond geographic variation",hard,mechanism
crc_microbiome_014,Describe the strain-specific gene carriage differences identified in Ruminococcus bicirculans and their functional implications for CRC progression,"Ruminococcus bicirculans SGB4262 showed significant phylogenetic associations with both late-stage CRC and metastatic CRC (top hit in both models with ELPD > 4). The species carried differentially abundant genes in CRC (Anpan taxon-wise q < 0.1, absolute estimate > 1), particularly genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism that showed higher carriage in later CRC stages. This is significant because carbohydrate metabolism is altered in CRC, and the findings suggest Firmicutes-specific metabolism could promote tumor differentiation. The strain-level analysis revealed that phylogenetic associations were independent of species-level abundance changes, indicating selection for specific R. bicirculans subclades during CRC progression",hard,mechanism
crc_microbiome_015,Compare the predictive performance and biological insights between using oral versus non-oral SGBs for CRC classification across different tumor characteristics,"When using only oral SGBs, the LODO approach achieved an average AUC of 0.83 compared to 0.85 with all SGBs, while non-oral SGBs alone achieved 0.79, indicating oral species contribute substantially but not exclusively to predictive power. For primary tumor location (right vs left), oral SGBs achieved an average AUC of 0.6 versus 0.66 with all SGBs. Significantly, 21 of 125 SGBs (16.8%) positively associated with CRC were oral-typical, compared to 34 of 488 (7.0%) non-significant SGBs (Fisher's test P < 0.01). At lower q thresholds (q < 0.05), 18 of 90 associated SGBs were oral. Dental plaque-associated species (11 of top oral SGBs) were more prevalent than tongue dorsum species (5 SGBs), suggesting biofilm-forming oral microbes play a major role in the intestinal CRC microbiome, particularly in right-sided tumors",hard,comparison
crc_microbiota_001,What are the main oral pathogens enriched in patients with colorectal cancer according to meta-analyses?,"Meta-analyses of faecal metagenomes from patients with CRC have identified several core oral pathogens that are enriched, most notably Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, P. anaerobius, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Solobacterium moorei and Prevotella intermedia",easy,factual
crc_microbiota_002,What percentage of gut microbial sequences are comprised of bacteria?,Bacteria comprise 93% of gut microbial sequences in the gastrointestinal tract,easy,factual
crc_microbiota_003,Which probiotic strains have been recognized for inhibiting carcinogen-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in rodents since the 1980s?,"Probiotic strains such as L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium longum have been recognized as being able to inhibit carcinogen-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in rodents since the early 1980s",easy,factual
crc_microbiota_004,What are the two main types of secondary bile acids generated from primary bile acids by gut bacteria?,Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic and lithocholic acids are generated from primary bile acids by the sequential actions of bacterial bile acid hydrolases and bile acid 7α-dehydroxylases,easy,factual
crc_microbiota_005,What percentage of patients with CRC have MSI-high or MMR-deficient disease that responds to immune checkpoint inhibitors?,Approximately 5% of patients with CRC have MMR-deficient or MSI-H disease that responds to immune checkpoint inhibitors. ICIs are largely ineffective in the remaining patients with microsatellite-stable CRC,easy,factual
crc_microbiota_006,How does Fusobacterium nucleatum promote colorectal tumorigenesis through its FadA adhesin?,"F. nucleatum expresses a cell-surface adhesin FadA which binds to E-cadherin on colonic epithelial cells and activates β-catenin signalling, leading to increased expression of cyclin D1, annexin A1 and Chk2 and tumorigenesis. Deletion of FadA impairs the ability of F. nucleatum to attach to and invade mammalian cells, thereby abrogating its tumour-promoting effects",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiota_007,Explain how Peptostreptococcus anaerobius promotes colorectal carcinogenesis at the molecular level,"P. anaerobius uses its putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (PCWBR2) protein to interact with integrin α2β1 on CRC cells, which in turn activates the PI3K–AKT signalling pathway via FAK kinase. Pharmacological blockade of integrin α2β1 using RDGS peptides has been shown to abolish the pro-tumorigenic effects of P. anaerobius in both CRC cells and in ApcMin/+ mice",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiota_008,How does colibactin produced by pks+ E. coli cause DNA damage that contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis?,"Colibactin is a genotoxin produced by E. coli harbouring the pks pathogenicity island. It forms DNA adducts and crosslinks, leading to double-strand breaks that result in AT-rich hexameric sequence motifs. The locations of colibactin-induced double-strand breaks correspond with mutational hotspots in the CRC genome, emphasizing its role in CRC tumorigenesis",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiota_009,What is the mechanism by which enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis induces inflammation and promotes CRC?,"Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis-elicited inflammation begins with loss of gut barrier function, leading to rapid activation of the TH17 cell-dependent inflammatory cascade and activation of STAT3 and NF-κB signalling in IL-17R-expressing colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis inhibits exosomal miR-149-3p release from CRC cells to facilitate TH17 cell differentiation, forming a positive feedforward cycle. Blockade of IL-17 signalling abolishes this inflammation and inhibits CRC development",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiota_010,How do short-chain fatty acids like butyrate exert their anticancer effects in colorectal cancer?,"Butyrate exerts anticancer effects through multiple mechanisms: (1) By acting as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC), it promotes histone acetylation and expression of tumour suppressor proteins such as FAS, p21 and p27. (2) SCFAs bind to several tumour-suppressive G protein-coupled receptors including FFAR3, FFAR2 and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 expressed on non-malignant colonic epithelial cells. (3) Butyrate activates IFNγ+CD8+ T cells and NK cells, and (4) epigenetically activates ID2-mediated upregulation of IL-12 receptor expression in CD8+ T cells",medium,mechanism
crc_microbiota_011,What is the role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in gut dysbiosis-mediated CRC progression?,"Pathobionts foster an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by promoting intratumoural MDSC infiltration. Gut dysbiosis or the presence of pathogenic bacteria like F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius induces tumour-derived CXCL1, an MDSC chemoattractant. Microbial activation of the TLR–calcineurin–NFAT–IL-6 signalling cascade on polymorphonuclear MDSCs further promotes crosstalk with CRC cells to induce STAT3-dependent expression of co-inhibitory proteins B7H3/4, leading to suppression of cytotoxic T cells",hard,mechanism
crc_microbiota_012,"Compare the roles of bacterial dysbiosis versus non-bacterial dysbiosis (fungi, viruses, Archaea) in colorectal cancer pathogenesis","Bacterial dysbiosis is the most studied aspect, with enrichment of oral pathogens like F. nucleatum and depletion of beneficial bacteria forming pathobiont networks. Non-bacterial components show: (1) Viruses: enteric viromes altered with enrichment of Orthobunyavirus, Inovirus and Tunalikevirus genera, with trans-kingdom interactions between viral and bacterial communities. (2) Fungi: distinct mycobiome profiles with elevated Basidiomycota:Ascomycota ratio and enrichment of Aspergillus species, showing co-occurrence with pathogenic bacteria. (3) Archaea: greater abundance of halophilic Archaea but fewer methanogenic Archaea, with archaeal species correlating with oncogenic bacteria. Multi-kingdom interactions are evident, with bacteria-fungi showing strongest inter-kingdom interaction patterns",hard,comparison
crc_microbiota_013,How does Fusobacterium nucleatum have contrasting effects on chemotherapy resistance versus immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy?,"F. nucleatum shows paradoxical effects: For chemotherapy, it promotes resistance to both oxaliplatin and 5-FU by eliciting protective autophagy through TLR4–MyD88 signalling and miR-18a*/4802-mediated repression of autophagy genes. It also drives NF-κB signalling and BIRC3 expression, inhibiting apoptosis. However, for immune checkpoint therapy, F. nucleatum paradoxically enhances anti-PD-L1 antibody efficacy. While colonization activates STING–NF-κB signalling and PD-L1 expression in CRC cells, it also promotes CD8+ T cell activation when PD-L1 is inhibited. Patients with tumours harbouring F. nucleatum or high faecal levels show improved responses and progression-free survival on anti-PD-1 antibodies",hard,comparison
crc_microbiota_014,Describe the interplay between gut microbiota-derived gallic acid and mutant p53 in colorectal tumorigenesis,"The gut microbiota can switch mutant p53 from tumour-suppressive to oncogenic function. Depletion of gut microbiota using antibiotics supports the tumour-suppressive potential of mutant p53 in the distal colon in conditional Trp53R270H-knockin mice, attenuating colorectal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, gut microbiota-derived gallic acid abolishes the tumour-suppressing function of mutant p53 and promotes CRC development in Trp53R270H mice via hyperactivation of WNT signalling. This demonstrates that genetic alterations and gut microbiota must work together in tumorigenesis",hard,mechanism
crc_microbiota_015,How does Streptococcus thermophilus-derived β-galactosidase suppress CRC development through metabolic reprogramming?,"S. thermophilus suppresses CRC development in azoxymethane/DSS-exposed or ApcMin/+ mice through its secreted β-galactosidase protein. This enzyme catalyses the formation of galactose both in vitro and in vivo, which impairs glucose utilization and activates oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a 'reverse Warburg' effect. In this state, tumour cells become dependent on the same energy-generating processes as non-malignant cells (oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis), resulting in tumour suppression",hard,mechanism
crc_biomarkers_001,What percentage of stage I-III CRC patients relapse within 5 years after tumor removal?,"24% of patients with stage I-III CRC relapse within 5 years after tumor removal, with more than half of these cases occurring within 2 years",easy,factual
crc_biomarkers_002,How many CRC patients were included in the study and what was the median follow-up period for progression?,333 patients with primary CRC were included in the study. The median follow-up period was 27.6 months for progression (with 29.5 months for non-progressed patients) and 43.6 months for overall survival,easy,factual
crc_biomarkers_003,What are the two main enterotypes observed in CRC patients and which bacterial genera represent them?,"The gut microbiota of CRC patients was clustered into two enterotypes: enterotype 1 dominated by Bacteroides and enterotype 2 dominated by Prevotella, with a reciprocal distribution of these representative genera",easy,factual
crc_biomarkers_004,What are the four novel prognostic bacteria identified in addition to Fusobacterium nucleatum?,"The four novel prognostic bacteria identified are: Bacteroides sp. (assigned to Alistipes including A. dispar and A. senegalensis), Pyramidobacter piscolens, and Dialister invisus. These bacteria indicated a high risk of CRC progression",easy,factual
crc_biomarkers_005,"In the M5-low group, how many patients progressed out of the total?","In the M5-low group, only 2 patients progressed out of 74 total patients, indicating a very low rate of progression for patients with high Prevotella abundance and no pathobionts",easy,factual
crc_biomarkers_006,How does the prevalence of Prevotella differ between Western and non-Western populations according to the meta-analysis?,"A meta-analysis of over 6,500 metagenomes found that P. copri prevalence is 95.4% among individuals living a non-Western lifestyle compared to only 29.6% among individuals with a Western lifestyle. In the Korean cohort studied, Prevotella was detected in 90.7% of CRC patients (302/333) with a median abundance of 15.8%",medium,comparison
crc_biomarkers_007,Explain how the microbial hazard score M5 was constructed and what scores were assigned to different risk categories,"The M5 score was constructed using five bacteria: Prevotella genus and four pathobionts (Bacteroides sp., P. piscolens, D. invisus, and F. nucleatum). A score of 1 was assigned to samples with low Prevotella abundance (<16.1%), and a score of 1 was assigned for each pathobiont present. The scores were categorized into: M5-low (score 0), M5-moderate (scores 1-2), and M5-high (scores 3-5) for clear stratification of patient risk",medium,mechanism
crc_biomarkers_008,What screening method was used to identify prognostic bacterial species and what were the selection criteria?,"Among 438 bacterial species, 79 species with prevalence ≥10% and relative abundance ≥0.01% were selected for screening. Both univariate log-rank survival test and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed using the entire dataset and 1000 random subsamples. Species with high effect size (HR >1.5) and significance (FDR <0.1) were selected as prognostic biomarkers, with the number of consistent discriminations in both discovery and validation sets used to measure robustness",medium,mechanism
crc_biomarkers_009,What were the adjusted hazard ratios for the four novel prognostic pathobionts after controlling for confounding factors?,"After adjustment for TNM stages, lymphatic invasion, neoadjuvant treatment, postoperative chemotherapy, and CEA level, the adjusted hazard ratios were: P. piscolens 2.52, D. invisus 2.30, F. nucleatum 2.04, and Bacteroides sp. 1.86. All species significantly predicted disease progression",medium,factual
crc_biomarkers_010,Describe the association between gut microbiota and clinical parameters using PERMANOVA,"PERMANOVA analysis revealed that gut microbiota based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was significantly associated with: clinicopathological stage (P=0.012), CRC progression (P=0.011), and decease (P=0.007). Additionally, TNM staging systems showed associations: T-stage (P=0.012), N-stage (P=0.063), and M-stage (P=0.01). However, neoadjuvant treatment, postoperative chemotherapy, comorbidity, and most medications were not associated with the gut microbiome",medium,mechanism
crc_biomarkers_011,"How did the bacterial families Akkermansiaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, and Prevotellaceae differ between patients with and without progression?","Akkermansiaceae and Fusobacteriaceae tended to increase in patients with progression (P=0.0039 and P=0.1575 respectively), while Prevotellaceae decreased (P=0.0228). This suggests that increased pathobiont families and decreased beneficial Prevotellaceae are associated with poorer CRC outcomes",medium,comparison
crc_biomarkers_012,Compare the performance of the M5 microbial hazard score with traditional clinical biomarkers in predicting CRC progression,"M5 outperformed all traditional biomarkers when added to the baseline model based on cancer stage. The concordance index increased from 0.69 (baseline) to 0.78 (with M5). The adjusted hazard ratios were: M5-high 19.54, M5-moderate 6.53, and M5-numerical 2.07 (95% CI 1.61-2.64, P=7.8e-9). This performance surpassed CEA, fibrinogen, age, lymphatic invasion, BMI, and NLR. The increase in C-index by M5 (+0.0876) was comparable to the combined consideration of CEA, lymphatic invasion, and age (+0.0885)",hard,comparison
crc_biomarkers_013,"What microbial pathways were identified through PICRUSt2 analysis as differentially abundant between M5-low and M5-high groups, and what is their functional significance?","PICRUSt2 identified 15 differentially abundant pathways (FDR <0.001, ΔTRFA >5). Nine beneficial pathways enriched in M5-low included: Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, thiamine diphosphate salvage II (P=0.0087), thiamine diphosphate biosynthesis I, flavin biosynthesis I, preQ0 biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Six detrimental pathways depleted in M5-low included: glycogen degradation I, glycolysis I and II, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside salvage, and L-histidine degradation I (P=0.032). The thiamine salvage pathway showed taxonomic contribution from various bacterial families forming a beneficial consortium, while detrimental pathways were mainly from Bacteroidaceae. Both pathways correlated with CD8+ T cell numbers in tumor epithelium",hard,mechanism
crc_biomarkers_014,Explain the clinical characteristics that differed between M5-low and M5-high groups and discuss the implications,"M5-high patients compared to M5-low showed: older age (68 vs 61 years, P=0.0656), higher CEA levels (57.7% vs 12.2% CEA-high, P=0.0001248), more advanced cancer stages (only 5.7% stage 0/1 vs 31.1% in M5-low, P=0.002322), increased lymphatic invasion (34.0% vs 24.3%), lower MSI (5.7% vs 21.2%, P=0.00797), and higher type 2 diabetes prevalence (28.3% vs 13.5%, P=0.119). The M5-high group also had lower alcohol consumption (15.1% vs 47.3%, P=0.001077) and more systemic illness (ASA class 3: 15.1% vs 4.1%). These findings suggest convergent characteristics between gut microbiota of CRC and metabolic diseases like diabetes",hard,comparison
crc_biomarkers_015,"What is the relationship between the oral microbiota and the identified prognostic biomarkers, and why might this be clinically significant?","Three of the four detrimental biomarkers originated from oral microbiota: F. nucleatum and D. invisus are found in human dental plaques and induce periodontal inflammation, while P. piscolens was first isolated from the human oral cavity and is associated with oral dysbiosis. This suggests that CRC treatment outcomes could be influenced by microbial homeostasis throughout the entire oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. The ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine may drive inflammation and worsen prognosis, highlighting the importance of oral-gut axis in CRC progression",hard,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_001,How many metagenomes were analyzed in this cross-cohort study of type 2 diabetes and the gut microbiome?,"The study analyzed 8,117 shotgun metagenomes from 10 cohorts, including 1,851 patients with T2D, 2,770 individuals with prediabetes, and 2,277 normoglycemic controls from the United States, Europe, Israel and China",easy,factual

This included MetaPhlAn 3.0 for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN 3.0.0 for functional profiling,easy,factual
t2d_microbiome_004,Which bacterial species enriched in T2D patients were identified as common oral cavity residents?,"Two Streptococcus species, common residents of the oral cavity, were enriched in individuals with T2D, suggesting a potential translocation of oral microbes to the gut, indicative of a pro-inflammatory state",easy,factual

t2d_microbiome_006,Describe the community-level microbial functional shift towards glucose dysregulation observed in T2D patients.,"The community-level microbial functional shift towards glucose dysregulation in T2D patients manifested as intertwined relationships between insulin resistance, glycolysis and glucose uptake. There was higher abundance of functions involved in glycolysis (like GLYCOLYSIS-PWY pathway and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), enrichment of methylglyoxal degradation pathway (METHGLYUT-PWY), high abundance of pitrilysin enzyme with insulin-degrading capability, and enrichment of saturated fatty acid biosynthesis functions that potentially contribute to insulin resistance",medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_007,How does the study address the confounding effect of metformin use on gut microbiome composition?,"The study confirmed that metformin use strongly confounded the association between microbes and T2D in this international population. They found different microbial compositions between metformin-treated versus -naïve T2D patients (PERMANOVA P < 0.001) and attenuated associations for many microbial species after further adjustment for metformin use. The modeling approach effectively addressed confounding by metformin use, demonstrated by a high correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.95) between beta coefficients from the primary analysis and those from a sensitivity analysis excluding metformin-treated T2D patients",medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_008,Explain how the biosynthesis of immunomodulatory bacterial structural components was altered in T2D patients.,"The study found upregulated biosynthesis of immunomodulatory bacterial structural components in T2D patients. Two pathways upstream of the production of highly pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and teichoic acids were enriched: lipid IVA biosynthesis (NAGLIPASYN-PWY) and poly (glycerol phosphate) wall teichoic acid biosynthesis (TEICHOICACID-PWY). Individual enzymes involved in LPS and teichoic acid biosynthesis were also enriched, such as peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.129) and lipid IVA 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.43). Positive associations between these LPS precursor biosynthesis enzymes and circulating hs-CRP levels further supported their immunogenicity",medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_009,What method did the study use to identify pathways in Prevotella copri that differ between T2D patients and controls while controlling for species-level abundance?,The study applied the pathway-specific random effects model in anpan (analysis of microbial phylogenies and genes) to identify functions encoded by P. copri that were differentially abundant between T2D patients versus controls while controlling for its species-level abundance. This model enables identification of microbial functions encoded by P. copri that are differentially abundant between patients with T2D and controls while controlling for species-level abundance,medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_010,Describe the batch effect correction method used in this study and its effectiveness.,"The study corrected batch and study effects using a method from the MMUPHin workflow (MMUPHin_Correct) specifically designed for zero-inflated microbiome sequencing profiles. This method differentiated between technical effects (batch, study) versus covariates of biological interest by extending batch correction methods based on linear models for gene expression data by adding a binary zero-count indicator. The method was effective, reducing the variance explained by batch effects from 8.4% to 4.0% (as quantified by PERMANOVA) while retaining biologically meaningful inter-individual variation",medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_011,How did the inclusion of microbial species improve the classification performance of random forest models distinguishing T2D from controls?,"In random forest models classifying metformin-naïve T2D versus normoglycemic controls, there was a moderate improvement in the average AUC from the basic model (age, sex, BMI: average AUC 0.63) to the model that additionally included microbial species (average AUC 0.69). For models classifying metformin-treated T2D versus controls, the average AUC was 0.69 in the basic model and increased to 0.79 in the model that included microbial species, demonstrating significant improvement in classification performance",medium,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_012,Compare the functional capacity for branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in different Prevotella copri subclades and explain how this relates to T2D risk.,"P. copri in T2D patients was more likely to carry biosynthetic functions of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), a group of diabetogenic metabolites, including the super-pathway of BCAA biosynthesis (BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY), l-valine biosynthesis (VALSYN-PWY), l-isoleucine biosynthesis I (ILEUSYN-PWY), and branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase. The abundance of these functions was significantly lower in P. copri dominated by clade A compared with P. copri with co-presence of all clades. However, the upregulated BCAA biosynthesis in T2D patients was unique to P. copri clade A and was not detected in other P. copri subclades. This shows that the BCAA biosynthesizing capacity of P. copri is subclade and population dependent",hard,comparison
t2d_microbiome_013,Describe the within-species phylogenetic analysis approach used to identify strain-level associations with T2D and provide an example of findings from Eubacterium rectale.,"The study used anpan's phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) to assess the extent to which within-species phylogeny accounted for inter-individual heterogeneity in T2D risk. Within-species phylogenetic divergence was associated with inter-individual differences in T2D risk for 27 species. For E. rectale specifically, strong associations were observed between strains from Southern China and T2D in subclade B (predominantly composed of strains from Chinese and US white participants). Subclade C, containing strains from diverse geographical origins, showed strong associations between a strain from the US Hispanic population and another from Northern European populations with T2D. The analysis identified phylogenies of species linked to T2D based on difference in ELPD (ΔELPD) ≥ 4 and ΔELPD − (2 × s.e. of ΔELPD) > 0",hard,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_014,Explain the strain-specific functional variations identified in Escherichia coli and their potential mechanisms for contributing to T2D pathogenesis.,"The study identified several clusters of E. coli strains with specific virulence factors and mechanisms. T2D-enriched Block 5 (from Chinese and Swedish populations) was enriched in gene families involved in various horizontal gene transfer mechanisms (mobile genetic elements, phages, conjugation, genetic rearrangement), including genes for plasmid virulence (UniRef90_A0A376NZ25) in enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) and LPS biosynthesis protein (UniRef90_A0A3E1VFS6). T2D-enriched Block 3 showed enrichment in rearrangement hotspot element (rhsA), YD-peptide repeat, and vgrG proteins, as well as Ail/Lom family proteins. Blocks 1 and 4 contained genes encoding adherence factors including putative adhesin and fimbrial protein. The T2D-depleted cluster (Block 2) contained gene families associated with microbial response to environmental stress, conferring adaptive advantages",hard,mechanism
t2d_microbiome_015,"What novel biological processes underlying metabolic risk were identified through gene ontology enrichment analysis of strain-specific genes, and which species demonstrated these findings?","The gene ontology enrichment analysis identified 31 GO terms associated with T2D (FDR < 0.10). In T2D patients, enriched GO terms encompassed biological processes related to glycolysis, biosynthesis of bacterial structural components, survival in adverse conditions, virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. Notably, GO terms related to horizontal gene transfer explained strain-level diversity in multiple species. Taking E. rectale as an example, genes involved in flagellum-dependent cell motility and chemotaxis were more prevalent in T2D patients, indicating strain-specific adaptations to oxidative stress and inflammation in the gut. Conversely, the GO term of quorum sensing was enriched in normoglycemic controls, suggesting survival advantages of the strains",hard,mechanism
gut_diabetes_001,What are the consistent features of altered gut microbiota composition found in type 2 diabetes across epidemiological studies worldwide?,Consistent features of altered GM composition in type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance include reduced diversity and decreased abundance of bacteria that produce the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate.

gut_diabetes_006,Explain how metformin alters the gut microbiota to mediate its glucose-lowering effects according to intervention studies.,"Randomized trials and studies in drug-naive individuals demonstrate that metformin-induced GM compositional changes translate to enhanced production of propionate and butyrate, and modulation of bile acid pools. These changes may mediate some of the glucose-lowering effects of metformin. The GM compositional changes include increased Escherichia species and decreased Intestinibacter bartlettii.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_007,Describe the mechanism by which SCFAs regulate glucose metabolism through enteroendocrine cells.,"In the colon, SCFAs activate enteroendocrine cells (EECs) via binding to GPCRs and free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 to induce the release of gut peptides, mainly GLP-1 and peptide YY. GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion, promoting insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatic glucose production. SCFAs also maintain gut health as butyrate is the primary fuel source for colonocytes.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_008,How do bile acids contribute to glucose metabolism and what role does the gut microbiota play in bile acid metabolism?,"Bile acids are amphipathic molecules that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism. Alterations in bile acid pools are linked to type 2 diabetes. The GM can deconjugate and transform bile acids, contributing to a highly variable but important portion of human bile acid pools. Increased levels of 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and decreased levels of 6α-hydroxylated bile acids are linked to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. The GM affects bile acid affinity for both FXR and TGR5 receptors through deconjugation and metabolism into secondary bile acids.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_009,Explain the role of the gut microbiota in gut barrier functioning and how its impairment contributes to diabetes pathophysiology.,"The GM plays a vital role in gut barrier functioning. Impairment leads to a leaky gut, contributing to low-grade systemic inflammation characteristic of obesity and diabetes. One mechanism is increased circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria (metabolic endotoxemia). LPSs act on toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) throughout the body to elicit pro-inflammatory immune responses that negatively affect glucose homeostasis. Additionally, accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages, CD8αβ T cell infiltration, and reduced IgA+ immune cells in the intestines contribute to insulin resistance.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_010,What is the mechanism by which imidazole propionate and BCAAs affect insulin signaling?,"Imidazole propionate, a bacterial product of histidine metabolism with increased plasma levels in individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and BCAAs impair insulin signaling through activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), leading to impaired phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and insulin resistance.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_011,Describe how dietary fiber improves glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes through the gut microbiota according to intervention studies.,"In one study, a high-fiber diet improved glucose tolerance in individuals with type 2 diabetes, associated with increased faecal butyrate levels and circulating GLP-1. Non-digestible carbohydrates serve as energy sources for specific bacteria containing enzymes that metabolize fibers and promote SCFA production. The beneficial effects of fibers on HbA1c may be mediated by the specific baseline GM composition and diversity of fiber-promoted SCFA-producing bacteria.",medium,mechanism
gut_diabetes_012,Compare the prevalence of Prevotella copri between Western and non-Western lifestyle populations and explain the significance.,"A meta-analysis of over 6,500 metagenomes found that P. copri prevalence is 95.4% among individuals living a non-Western lifestyle and only 29.6% among individuals with a Western lifestyle. This stark difference highlights how diet and lifestyle dramatically shape gut microbiota composition. P. copri has been associated with increased fiber intake and may reflect dietary patterns, with variable effects on metabolic health depending on specific strains and individual context.",hard,comparison
gut_diabetes_013,"What are the key differences between conventional probiotics and next-generation probiotics for diabetes treatment, and what evidence exists for their efficacy?","Conventional probiotics (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains) have a history of use in fermented foods with prospective RCTs ongoing for type 1 diabetes and some efficacy shown in type 2 diabetes meta-analyses for metabolic control and reduced insulin resistance. Next-generation probiotics are newly identified indigenous human GM members associated with health (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila, specific Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains). However, despite associations with healthy metabolic phenotypes, an RCT with A. muciniphila did not identify strong metabolic effects, possibly due to reduced viability upon passage through the stomach, inadequate dosages, or lack of engraftment. The challenge is that strain-level differences are highly meaningful, and effects from one strain cannot be generalized to all strains of a species.",hard,comparison
gut_diabetes_014,"How does Mendelian randomization provide evidence for causal effects of the gut microbiota on type 2 diabetes, and what are its limitations?","Mendelian randomization (MR) uses human genetic variants related to exposures to discriminate causal effects from associations that result from confounding or reverse causation. For GM research, the GM feature must be affected by human genetic variants strongly enough to use as instruments. Sanna et al identified human genetic variants associated with faecal SCFA levels and reported evidence for a potential causal connection between the GM's butyrate production potential and improved insulin response, and between abnormal faecal propionate levels and increased type 2 diabetes risk. Limitations include pleiotropy, problems with weak instrumental variables, and the challenge that host genetic variants must adequately mimic specific GM features. Large, high-quality studies are needed considering both MR limitations and GM research challenges (methodological differences, interindividual heterogeneity, intraindividual variability).",hard,mechanism
gut_diabetes_015,Explain the importance of studying small intestine microbiota in diabetes research and describe the technological challenges and solutions.,"The small intestine overshadows the large intestine regarding metabolic regulation: it's home to EECs producing GLP-1 and other incretin hormones, plays essential roles in glucose and fat uptake/metabolism, and its microbiota regulates EEC function and nutrient absorption. Recent work shows specific small intestine microbiota members can inhibit lipid secretion and affect nutrient-induced gut-brain signaling regulating glucose homeostasis. However, it's understudied due to limitations in acquiring samples and reduced microbial abundance. Novel technologies include ingestible capsules triggered by different pH levels along the GI tract to sample throughout, though challenges remain (microbes may continue growing post-collection, giving inaccurate representation; currently developed for fasting state, limiting postprandial response studies which are important for understanding microbial contributions to glucose metabolism regulation).",hard,mechanism

This ratio is consistent with values reported in the intestine",medium,factual
gut_health_004,Explain how butyrate functions as an anti-carcinogen in colon cancer,Butyrate has the potential to act as an anti-carcinogen by persuading apoptosis of colon cancer cells and regulating gene expression through inhibiting histone deacetylase.

It is a prominent and essential Archean in the gut microbiota,medium,mechanism
gut_health_006,Describe how gut microbiota contributes to the development of obesity through energy regulation,"Gut microbiota contributes to obesity through several mechanisms: (1) reducing fatty acid oxidation by suppressing AMPK in muscle and liver, leading to increased fat accumulation, (2) inducing systematic inflammation causing metabolic disturbance, (3) fermenting dietary polysaccharides to produce SCFAs that stimulate lipogenesis and boost triglyceride storage, and (4) suppressing FIAF which inhibits lipoprotein lipase, causing accumulation of triglycerides in adipocytes",hard,mechanism
gut_health_007,What is TMAO and how is it related to cardiovascular disease?,"TMAO (trimethylamine-N-oxide) is a metabolite derived from gut microbiota. TMA lyase contributes to its generation, and TMAO has been shown to contribute to the development of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease in animal studies and appears significantly linked in human studies, playing a primary role in developing atherosclerotic CVD",medium,mechanism
gut_health_008,How does gut microbiota composition differ between type 1 diabetes patients and healthy controls?,"Type 1 diabetes subjects have a distinct gut microbiota composition. In control groups, lactate and butyrate-producing bacteria cause mucin formation to sustain gut integrity. In contrast, type 1 diabetes patients have non-butyrate producing lactate-utilizing bacteria that inhibit mucin synthesis, contributing to autoimmunity of β-cells. Additionally, increased occurrence of Akkermansia muciniphila is inversely related to the probability of developing type 1 diabetes",hard,comparison
gut_health_009,What changes in gut microbiota are observed in inflammatory bowel disease patients?,"IBD patients show decreased intestinal microbiota diversity, primarily due to reduction of Firmicutes. Significant decreases in Firmicutes and increases in Proteobacteria are the most important observations. Among Firmicutes, there is a decline in Clostridium leptum groups, particularly Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. There is also increased abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD",hard,mechanism
gut_health_010,What is the difference between eubiosis and dysbiosis?,"Eubiosis is a well-balanced gut microbial community where microbes reside in mutual association with the host, affecting health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells. Dysbiosis is the variation in gut microbiota composition that differs from the normal state and is associated with various diseases",easy,definition
gut_health_011,How does the gut microbiota respond to dietary changes?,"The gut microbiota reacts efficiently to major dietary changes. The structure and composition of the microbiome can change over 1-2 days when individuals switch between plant and meat-based diets, add more than 30g of specific dietary fibers daily, or adapt high-fiber-low-fat versus low-fiber-high-fat diets for ten days. This flexibility is confirmed by evidence from various dietary intervention studies",medium,mechanism
gut_health_012,What role do SCFAs play in hypertension regulation?,"SCFAs play a crucial role in maintaining gut microbiome homeostasis and host immunity, and are involved in modulating blood pressure. SCFAs have the potential to stimulate host G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) pathways that affect the secretion of renin and blood pressure. Studies have shown that lyxose levels (a by-product of intestinal microbial fermentation) were higher in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension",hard,mechanism
gut_health_013,Which bacterial species are associated with colorectal cancer development?,"Several bacterial species are linked with colorectal cancer development, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobic.

diabetes_ml_006,How did reducing the feature set from 1000 to 500 sOTUs affect the sensitivity of the random forest model for diabetes status screening?,"Reducing the dataset from 1000 to 500 features dramatically improved sensitivity for the RF model, increasing it by 74% from 0.46 to 0.80. The AUC also slightly improved from 0.76 to 0.77. This reduction mitigated overfitting by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, reducing multicollinearity, and addressing data sparsity",medium,mechanism
diabetes_ml_007,What cross-validation strategy was employed during the training stage and why?,"Repeated k-fold cross-validation was performed with five repeats of fivefold cross-validation at the training stage. This approach was used for training performance evaluation, ensuring robust model assessment by repeatedly partitioning the data into training and validation sets, which helps reduce variance in performance estimates and provides more reliable model evaluation",medium,mechanism

The abundance of Faecalibacterium was reduced in diabetes patients, aligning with previous studies showing reduction in Clostridiales order, particularly Roseburia species and F. prausnitzii, in patients with T2DM. F. prausnitzii appeared as a key feature in DT, EN, and RF models for diabetes classification",medium,mechanism
diabetes_ml_009,What specific alterations were made to model hyperparameters to accommodate the complexity of metagenomic data?,"Several hyperparameter adjustments were made: the iteration maxits of EN and SVMRK models were set to 10,000 iterations to accommodate varying complexity; the maximum depth of the DT model was set to 30 to account for data complexity while avoiding excessive overfitting; and the number of trees in RF analyses was set to 1,000 to ensure model stability and capture intricate relationships in the sOTU data, as RF is less prone to overfitting",medium,mechanism
diabetes_ml_010,How did the study address the issue of low sensitivity and high specificity in the initial models?,"The study addressed low sensitivity through multiple approaches: first, reducing features from 1000 to 500; second, adjusting the classification threshold from the default 0.5 to various levels (0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70) to explore trade-offs between true positives and false positives; third, using log10 normalization to reduce outlier importance and improve data interpretability; and fourth, increasing maximum iterations. A threshold of 0.65 ultimately resulted in significantly increased sensitivity values for diabetes status screening",medium,mechanism
diabetes_ml_011,Describe the diversity differences observed between subjects with and without diabetes,"Shannon index did not vary significantly between diabetes positive and negative groups (P=0.160), but richness was significantly higher in the negative-status group (P=0.003). Beta diversity measured by unweighted UniFrac distances differed significantly between groups (P=0.006). When comparing negative-status with T2DM subjects specifically, the negative-status group had higher Shannon index (P=0.028), higher feature richness (P<0.001), and different beta diversity (P=0.01), indicating reduced microbial diversity in diabetic subjects",medium,comparison
diabetes_ml_012,Compare the performance of models when classifying negative-status versus T2DM only versus negative-status versus all positive diabetes cases,"Models performed significantly better when classifying negative-status versus T2DM only compared to negative-status versus all positive cases. For EN models: AUC increased from 0.77 to 0.82 (P<0.001), sensitivity increased from 0.77 to 0.85 (P<0.001), and specificity increased from 0.64 to 0.63. For RF models: AUC increased from 0.75 to 0.80 (P<0.001), sensitivity increased from 0.80 to 0.87 (P<0.001), and specificity increased from 0.59 to 0.57 (P=0.009). This improved performance suggests T2DM has more distinct microbial signatures compared to the mixed diabetes group",hard,comparison
diabetes_ml_013,"What were the differential microbial signatures between T1DM and T2DM, and what do these differences suggest about the pathophysiology?","T1DM subjects showed enrichment of families Brucellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, Micrococcaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and Fusobacteriaceae, along with species like F. prausnitzii, B. uniformis, R. faecis, and B. obeum. T2DM subjects showed enrichment of R. torques, R. gnavus, Streptococcus, families Veillonellaceae and Streptococcaceae, and the order Gammaproteobacteria. Both groups varied in Shannon index (P=0.046), richness (P=0.047), and beta diversity (P=0.001). These differences suggest distinct microbial dysbiosis patterns between autoimmune-driven T1DM and metabolic-driven T2DM, though the study notes that T2DM is more closely related to lifestyle factors and age",hard,mechanism
diabetes_ml_014,"Why did the diabetes typing models perform poorly compared to screening models, and what are the implications for future research?","Diabetes typing models performed poorly across all iterations, with EN and RF achieving best AUC values of only 0.66 and 0.64 respectively for 500 features, but with consistently low sensitivity. The main limitation was the unbalanced dataset (76 T1DM vs 366 T2DM samples), which contributed to bias toward negative classification. The study suggests future improvements require: more balanced datasets, controlled clinical settings, external validation using independent metagenomic datasets, inclusion of demographic and clinical variables as additional predictors, and larger sample sizes. The poor performance highlights the complexity of distinguishing diabetes types based solely on microbiome profiles",hard,mechanism
diabetes_ml_015,How do the findings regarding Roseburia species relate to the progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes and T2DM?,"The study found complex relationships with Roseburia: R. faecis was enriched in both the negative-status group and T1DM subjects, marking healthy controls, while general Roseburia sOTU was found enriched in positive-status subjects. The paper notes that Roseburia has been negatively correlated with obesity and T2DM, and due to its role in modulating glucose homeostasis, its dysbiosis has been proposed to play a role in progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes. Zhang et al. found that Lachnospira, along with SCFA-producing bacteria like Roseburia and Clostridium, are significantly reduced in T2DM subjects. This suggests different Roseburia species may have varying roles in diabetes pathogenesis",hard,mechanism

After weaning, there are noticeable changes in gut microbiota composition primarily due to altered diet, resulting in an expansion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes which can metabolize more complex polysaccharides",medium,mechanism
diet_microbiome_006,Explain how SCFAs benefit human health through GPCR signaling,"SCFAs exhibit several health benefits by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stimulating the secretion of satiety hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY) from enteroendocrine cells. This influences appetite regulation and modulates the function of regulatory T cells, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism, playing a pivotal role in regulating host energy metabolism and colonic homeostasis",hard,mechanism
diet_microbiome_007,How do polyphenols exert antimicrobial effects?,"Polyphenols can inhibit bacterial growth through several mechanisms, including binding to and altering the functional features of cell membranes. They exert antimicrobial activities against foodborne pathogens and serve as quorum-sensing inhibitors and antimicrobial agents in a dose-dependent manner",medium,mechanism
diet_microbiome_008,What percentage of polyphenols are absorbed in the small intestine versus those that interact with gut microorganisms?,"Small quantities of polyphenols (5% to 10%) are absorbed in the small intestine, predominantly those featuring monomeric and dimeric structures. The majority of polyphenols (90% to 95%) interact with gut microorganisms in the ileum and colon, where they promote the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Lactobacillus species",easy,factual

diet_microbiome_010,Describe the effects of a ketogenic diet on gut microbiota composition,"A ketogenic diet shows substantial reductions in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla, with 19 species of beneficial Bifidobacterium decreased. There is an increase in Bacteroidetes species. These alterations are partially induced through host production of ketone bodies. There is a substantial inverse correlation between Bifidobacterium spp. and the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB)",hard,mechanism
diet_microbiome_011,How does the ketogenic diet affect intestinal TH17 cells?,"The ketogenic diet leads to variations in intestinal T helper 17 (TH17) cell accumulation through changes in gut microbiota composition. Transplanting fecal microbiota from ketogenic diet-fed human donors into germ-free mice led to lower pro-inflammatory TH17 cells in both gut and adipose tissues, highlighting the impact of ketogenic diet on immune responses",hard,mechanism
diet_microbiome_012,What are the characteristics of the Western diet and its effects on gut microbiome diversity?,"The Western diet is characterized by high calorie content, enriched in animal protein, saturated fats, simple sugars and ultra-processed foods, with inadequate amounts of fiber, fruits and vegetables. It is associated with a marked reduction in gut microbiome diversity compared to other diets, with a shift towards an enterosignature dominated by Bacteroides species",easy,factual
diet_microbiome_013,Compare the prevalence of Prevotella enterotype between African and US populations in the METS-Microbiome study,"In the METS-Microbiome study using amplicon sequencing and metabolomics on 1,904 individuals, the Prevotella enterotype had higher prevalence in Africans, with 81% in Ghana and 62% in South Africa. The Bacteroides enterotype was more prevalent in US (75%) and Jamaican cohorts (68%)",medium,comparison
diet_microbiome_014,How does immigration to the USA affect gut microbiome composition?,"A study of 514 stool samples from first and second-generation immigrants from Hmong and Karen communities revealed substantial changes in gut microbiome. Reduced gut microbial diversity and a shift from Prevotella to Bacteroides species dominance led to loss of key strains, resulting in diminished fiber degradation capability, including loss of specific glycoside hydrolases (GH17, GH64, GH87, GH5 and GH26)",hard,mechanism
diet_microbiome_015,What role do human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) play in infant health?,"HMOs function as prebiotics, protecting infants from infections, promoting brain development and mucus barrier, reducing intestinal permeability and exerting immunomodulatory effects. HMOs modulate the infant gut microbiota and provide long-term protection from allergy, atopic dermatitis and obesity, as well as enhanced intestinal barrier function",hard,mechanism

microbiota_health_005,Which bacterial species are increased in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients?,"T2DM patients show increased levels of Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus, Proteus, and Enterococcus, while showing decreased abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria like Faecalibacterium and Roseburia",easy,factual
microbiota_health_006,How does the gut microbiota influence the gut-brain axis through GABA regulation?,"Chronic feeding with lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus rhamnosus on mice showed region-dependent alterations in GABA gene expression, with upregulation in cortical regions and downregulation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and locus coeruleus, indicating that gut microbiota can influence neurophysiology and behavior",medium,mechanism
microbiota_health_007,What is the role of secretory IgA (sIgA) in maintaining microbiota homeostasis?,"sIgA can bind and form complexes with commensal bacteria, which selectively presents the bacterial components to tolerogenic dendritic cells. As an anti-inflammatory molecule, sIgA reduces the inflammatory response that could result from the immense bacteria load in the organs. sIgA induction is a gradual response to bacterial exposure, suggesting a crosstalk between microbiota and immune system",medium,mechanism
microbiota_health_008,Explain how Porphyromonas gingivalis contributes to oral cancer development,"P. gingivalis contributes to oral cancer through multiple mechanisms: (1) binding to TLR4 receptor to activate NF-κB and JAK1/STAT3 pathways, inhibiting cell apoptosis, (2) interfering with cell cycle regulation by affecting cyclins, p53, and PI3K signaling pathways, (3) inducing noncanonical activation of β-catenin via gingipain-dependent proteolytic processing, upregulating oncogenes like CyclinD-1 and c-Myc, and (4) inducing chronic inflammation by increasing cytokines IL-8, TGF-β1, and TNF-α",hard,mechanism
microbiota_health_009,What is the difference between the lytic cycle and lysogenic cycle in bacteriophage infection?,"In the lysogenic cycle, phages insert their genome into bacteria genome and render prophages, which guarantees the replication of phage DNA and entrance into the lytic cycle. In the lytic cycle, phage DNA starts replication, modification and expression, resulting in new phage assembly, cell lysis and phage spreading",medium,mechanism
microbiota_health_010,How does TMAO contribute to cardiovascular disease development?,"TMAO (trimethylamine-N-oxide) contributes to CVD by: (1) activating MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, (2) regulating cholesterol balance and bile acid levels, and (3) being associated with early atherosclerosis and high long-term mortality risk. The MAPK pathway stimulates expression of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, while NF-κB promotes monocyte recruitment contributing to atherosclerosis pathogenesis",hard,mechanism

CST I, III and IV are commonly found in women",easy,factual
microbiota_health_012,Compare the gut microbiota composition between COPD patients during exacerbations versus healthy individuals,"During COPD exacerbations, studies identified altered abundance of Pseudomonas, Moraxella, Lactobacillus, and Haemophilus. Garcia-Nuñez et al. reported that the bronchial microbe Proteobacteria may induce chronic inflammation and predict high disease severity. COPD patients also showed increased bacterial load and diversity, with increased abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes",hard,comparison
microbiota_health_013,How do short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate blood pressure?,"SCFAs regulate blood pressure through G-protein-coupled receptors Gpr41, Gpr43, and Olfr78. Olfr78, expressed in smooth muscle cells of vasculature, activates adenylate cyclase type 3 and Golf to induce cAMP production and increases hypertension by facilitating renin release. Gpr41 and Gpr43 activate Gαi and/or Gαo to decrease cAMP, counteracting the hypertensive effect of Olfr78. Propionate also regulates T cell balance and butyrate modulates blood pressure by inhibiting renal prorenin receptors and renin",hard,mechanism
microbiota_health_014,What happens to gut microbiota diversity during pregnancy from first to third trimester?,"During pregnancy from first to third trimesters, gut microbiota shows increased diversity and decreased richness. There is a compositional shift with increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. The changes include positive correlation between insulin and Collinsella, gastrointestinal polypeptide and Coprococcus, and adipokine with Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae",medium,mechanism
microbiota_health_015,Describe the three strategies for using engineered bacteria in cancer therapy,"The three strategies are: (1) utilizing native bacterial cytotoxicity where bacteria like Clostridium and Salmonella accumulate in tumor tissues to induce neutrophil infiltration and antitumor immune response, (2) engineering bacteria to directly express anticancer agents such as Cytolysin A to induce apoptosis, deliver cytokines like IL-2 and TNFSF14 to activate immune cells, or express tumor antigens to sensitize the immune system, and (3) using bacteria to transfer genetic material to cancer cells, including delivery of polypeptides with pro-apoptotic activity, anti-angiogenic factors, and shRNAs for gene silencing",hard,mechanism
microbiome_health_001,What are the main bacterial phyla that make up 90% of the gut microbiota?,"The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota",easy,factual

microbiome_health_006,How does the mode of delivery during birth affect the initial gut microbiome colonization of infants?,"Infants born naturally are inoculated by the mother's vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas those born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to the skin microbiota as well as the microbiome found in the environment. At 3 days, infants who were naturally delivered possessed a greater abundance and variety of Bifidobacterium spp. than Caesarean-born babies",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_007,What is the mechanism by which Propionibacterium acnes survives on human skin?,"Propionibacterium acnes thrives in the anoxic sebaceous gland. This facultative anaerobe utilizes proteases to obtain amino acids from skin proteins, as well as lipases to degrade triglycerides that retrieve free fatty acids, facilitating bacterial adherence",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_008,How does Helicobacter pylori affect the gastric microbiome composition?,"H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients, and most H. pylori strains can modulate the gastric environment, thus altering the habitat of resident microorganisms. Eradicating H. pylori increased microbial diversity in the stomach",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_009,Explain how gut bacteria contribute to host energy harvesting and metabolic efficiency,"Gut bacteria play a key role in processing nutrients and metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and amino acids. By doing so, some of these bacteria facilitate host energy harvesting and metabolic efficiency. Microbe-synthesized metabolites potentially mediate crosstalk between the metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine systems, thus governing host wellness",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_010,How does dysbiosis lead to inflammatory bowel disease according to the paper?,"Dysbiosis in the gut potentially contributes to IBD pathogenesis through a reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia spp. These are butyrate-producing bacteria, with butyrate being the primary energy substrate for colonocytes. A decrease in Firmicutes could heighten local inflammation by decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokines",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_011,What is the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and urinary tract infections?,"The vaginal microbiota may impact the host's susceptibility to UTI. Women with recurrent UTI become resistant if their vaginal microbiome is altered by the administration of probiotics, especially Lactobacillus crispatus. Furthermore, women with bacterial vaginosis caused by the overgrowth of anaerobic species such as Gardnerella vaginalis suffer more UTIs than women with microbiomes composed mainly of Lactobacillus. Temporary exposure to some strains of Gardnerella vaginalis triggers the activation of E. coli from dormant intracellular reservoirs in the bladder",medium,mechanism
microbiome_health_012,"Compare the microbiome composition and diversity between different anatomical locations in the small and large intestines, and explain the environmental factors that create these differences","The large intestine has slow flow rates and pH level ranges from mildly acidic to neutral, comprising the largest microbial community dominated by obligate anaerobes. It comprises several microenvironments: the epithelial surface and inner mucin layer harbor minimal colonization during healthy state, the diffuse mucin layer has specialist colonizers such as Akkermansia muciniphila, and the liquid phase comprises diverse microorganisms and specialized primary colonizers like Ruminococcus spp. In contrast, the small intestine has a fairly short transit time of 3-5 hours and high bile concentrations with antimicrobial activity, making it a challenging environment. The jejunal and ileal components comprise mainly facultative anaerobes, including Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, Streptococci, Lactobacilli, and Enterococci species",hard,comparison
microbiome_health_013,"Describe the complex cascade of events that leads from respiratory dysbiosis to respiratory exacerbations, including the role of environmental changes, inflammatory responses, and bacterial growth","Respiratory exacerbations are acute events of respiratory dysbiosis accompanied by a dysregulated host immune response. In some disease states, increased airway wall permeability and mucus production introduce nutrient supply to the normally sparse lung environment. The mucus introduces pockets of increased temperature and decreased oxygen tension, selectively favoring the growth of disease-associated microbes. Enhanced immunogenicity exposes airways and alveoli to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and microbial metabolites that provoke further inflammation, which in turn further alters airway conditions. The generation of intraalveolar catecholamines and inflammatory cytokines promotes the growth of select bacterial species such as P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia cepacia complex, whereas the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells kills and clears bacteria with variable, species-specific effectiveness. Homeostasis is only restored after the disconnection of this positive feedback loop",hard,mechanism
microbiome_health_014,"Explain how the holobiont theory differs from the traditional pathogen-focused approach to understanding disease development, and what implications this has for therapeutic strategies","Instead of looking at the relationship between one specific microorganism with its host, a holistic approach based on the holobiont theory has been applied. The beneficial interplay of the host and its microbiome is responsible for maintaining the host's health, whereas disease development is often correlated with microbial dysbiosis or a shift in the microbiota. Pathogens represent only a tiny fraction of microorganisms, whereby the altered composition of the microbiome promotes the emergence and outbreak of pathogens. The vast majority of microbes are crucial for ecosystem functioning as well as beneficial interactions with other microbes, contributing to population dynamics and functional activities. Thus, opportunistic pathogens show that host-microbe interactions depend not only on the host but also on the entire microbiome. This implies that therapeutic strategies should focus on restoring the entire microbiome ecosystem rather than just eliminating specific pathogens",hard,comparison
microbiome_health_015,"Analyze the multi-factorial relationship between age, microbiome composition, and disease susceptibility across the human lifespan from infancy to old age","The microbiome changes significantly across the lifespan. In infancy, facultative anaerobes first colonize the gut at birth, creating anaerobic conditions that promote obligate anaerobes like Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides within 2 weeks. Mode of delivery and feeding method (breastfeeding vs formula) significantly affect initial colonization. By age 3, the microbiome resembles that of adults. In prepubescent children, increased hormones during puberty stimulate sebaceous glands, favoring growth of lipophilic microorganisms like Propionibacterium spp., Corynebacterium spp., and fungal Malassezia spp. This relates to disease susceptibility, with atopic dermatitis related to Staphylococcus more common in prepubescent children, while Malassezia-related tinea versicolor is more prominent in adults. In old age (>65 years), there is a decline in microbiota diversity with reduced Bifidobacteria and increased Enterobacteriaceae. The abundance of Bacteroidetes increases while Firmicutes becomes less abundant. Decreased immune activity makes elderly adults more susceptible to pathogens. The decrease in Bifidobacteria, which stimulates immune system and metabolic processes, may result in malnutrition and low systemic inflammatory status in older adults",hard,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_001,What are the three main categories of dietary fiber according to the Codex Alimentarius commission definition?,"The three categories are: (1) edible carbohydrate polymers naturally occurring in foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals; (2) edible carbohydrate polymers obtained from food raw materials by physical, enzymatic, and chemical means that have a proven physiological benefit; and (3) synthetic carbohydrate polymers with a proven physiological benefit",easy,factual

fiber_microbiota_003,Which bacterial species is considered a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch?,"Ruminoccocus bromii is considered a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch and contributes significantly to butyrate production in the colon, although the species itself does not produce butyrate",easy,factual
fiber_microbiota_004,"How many glycoside hydrolase, polysaccharide lyase, and carbohydrate esterase families does the gut microbiome harbor?","The gut microbiome harbors 130 glycoside hydrolase families, 22 polysaccharide lyase families, and 16 carbohydrate esterase families, which provide flexibility to switch between different energy sources of fibers depending on availability",easy,factual
fiber_microbiota_005,What bacterial phyla were found to be most abundant in Hadza hunter-gatherers compared to Italian controls?,"Hadza hunter-gatherers had higher levels of microbial richness and biodiversity, with increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes abundances. They almost lack the Actinobacteria phylum, including low levels of Bifidobacterium",easy,factual
fiber_microbiota_006,Explain the mechanism by which butyrate consumption by colonocytes creates an anaerobic environment in the gut,"Beta-oxidation of butyrate by colonocytes consumes oxygen, resulting in an anaerobic milieu in the gut. Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced when butyrate levels are low, creating a feedforward loop that increases luminal oxygen levels. This allows Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica to bloom",medium,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_007,How do Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii work together to regulate mucus production?,"Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an acetate and propionate producer, promotes goblet cell differentiation and expression of mucin-related genes. In contrast, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a consumer of acetate and a butyrate producer, reduces the effect of acetate on mucus and prevents overproduction of mucus, thus maintaining an appropriate structure and composition of the gut epithelium",medium,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_008,What happens to the gut microbiota when the diet is devoid of dietary fibers?,"When the diet is devoid of dietary fibers, prolonged lack damages the mucus barrier and is associated with increased abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria such as Akkermansia muciniphila. Some gut bacteria switch their metabolism to use mucin glycans by inducing gene expression of mucin-degrading enzymes. This leads to increased penetrability of the inner mucus layer and may increase susceptibility to infections",medium,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_009,How do SCFAs promote the generation of colonic regulatory T cells?,"SCFAs promote generation of colonic regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a GPR43-dependent manner as well as by inducing histone H3 acetylation. Additionally, maternal high-fiber feeding during pregnancy and lactation modulates thymic microenvironment and induces autoimmune regulator (Aire) expression, which contributes to enhanced peripheral and thymic Treg counts in a GPR41-dependent manner",medium,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_010,Describe the differences in SCFA production profiles between Hadza hunter-gatherers and Italian cohorts,"SCFA production in Hadza hunter-gatherers was characterized by increased propionate concentrations, while the Italian cohort had more butyrate. This segregation in SCFA production reflects differences in dietary variation related to the amount and type of fiber and carbohydrates consumed by both communities",medium,comparison
fiber_microbiota_011,What are the detrimental metabolites produced from protein fermentation when dietary fiber intake is low?,"When dietary fiber intake is low, gut microbial metabolism shifts toward utilization of dietary and endogenous proteins, leading to production of branched-chain fatty acids, ammonia, amines, N-nitroso compounds, phenolic compounds including p-Cresol, sulphides, indolic compounds, and hydrogen sulfide. These metabolites are cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory, contributing to the development of chronic diseases, particularly colorectal cancer",medium,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_012,Explain the concept of fiber binding as a platform for bile acid transformation and its health implications,Conjugated bile acids in the small intestine can bind to fibers before they are deconjugated by Bacteroides and Lactobacillus species. Binding of both bile acids and specific bacteria to the same fiber creates a platform that allows low abundant bacteria like Clostridium scindens to efficiently transform biomolecules and increase production of secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acids have been positively associated with both colorectal cancer and improved metabolism,hard,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_013,Compare the gut microbiota composition of children from rural Burkina Faso versus Italy and explain the impact of urbanization,"Children from rural Burkina Faso showed a significant increase in abundance of Prevotella and Xylanibacter genera associated with higher levels of fecal SCFAs, reflecting their ability to degrade complex carbohydrates. Children from urban areas of Burkina Faso had bacterial communities more similar to Italian children, with bacteria more suited to metabolize animal protein, fat, and sugar-rich foods. Rural Burkina Faso children had enrichment in Prevotella, Treponema, and Succinivibrio adapted for fiber and carbohydrate fermentation. These differences are independent of ethnicity, highlighting the important impact of diet over host genetics",hard,comparison
fiber_microbiota_014,Describe the generational effects of a low-MAC diet in mice and its implications for human populations,"Sonnenburg et al. investigated the consequences of lack of fiber (microbiota-accessible carbohydrates or MACs) intake in mice colonized with human microbiota. A low-MAC diet led to dramatically reduced microbial diversity in just three generations, which could not be restored when mice were moved back to a normal-MAC diet. This suggests that long-term reduction in fiber intake, like in the Western world, may lead to permanent extinction of important microbial taxa, potentially explaining reduced diversity in industrialized populations",hard,mechanism
fiber_microbiota_015,"How does personalized microbiota profiling predict metabolic response to dietary fiber, as demonstrated in the barley kernel-based bread study?","A study showed that supplementation of barley kernel-based bread (BKB) rich in beta-glucans did not result in metabolic improvement in all healthy subjects. Individuals who exhibited improved metabolic profile after 3 days of BKB consumption had a higher Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio with an enrichment of Prevotella copri, reflecting the ability to degrade complex carbohydrates. This demonstrates that the capacity for using fibers varies between Prevotella- versus Bacteroides-dominated gut microbiota, with Prevotella-dominated bacteria producing higher levels and different proportions of SCFAs",hard,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_001,What are the three main phyla affected by antibiotic treatment according to foundational studies?,"Foundational studies in healthy adult humans have demonstrated significant decreases in the relative abundance of important members of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, most notably Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium spp., Roseburia spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Dorea spp., Anaerostipes spp. and Ruminococcus spp.",easy,factual
antibiotic_microbiome_002,What is the resistome and how is it defined in the context of the gut microbiome?,The resistome refers to the suite of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) encoded by the microbiome. It represents the collection of all ARGs present within the gut microbial community,easy,factual
antibiotic_microbiome_003,How many deaths were associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance worldwide in 2019?,"In 2019, an estimated 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide",easy,factual
antibiotic_microbiome_004,Which bacterial species is considered a keystone species for resistant starch degradation?,"Ruminococcus bromii is considered a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch and contributes significantly to butyrate production in the colon, although the species itself does not produce butyrate",easy,factual
antibiotic_microbiome_005,What are the three mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer discussed in the paper?,"The three mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are: (1) transformation, which involves bacterial uptake of extracellular DNA; (2) transduction, during which bacteriophages serve as vectors for horizontal transfer of genetic material between bacterial hosts; and (3) conjugation, which describes the direct transfer of genetic material from a bacterial donor to a bacterial recipient",easy,factual
antibiotic_microbiome_006,How quickly can gut microbial communities respond to dramatic changes in macronutrient composition?,"Gut microbial communities respond within 24 hours to dramatic changes in macronutrient composition. Particularly, taxa with fiber-degrading capacity increase rapidly when humans are fed a plant-based diet. A dramatic and rapid rearrangement in the human microbiome within 24 hours after reduction of carbohydrate intake to 30 g/day has been observed",medium,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_007,Explain how spore-forming bacteria like Clostridioides difficile persist during antibiotic treatment,"Members of the Clostridium and Peptostreptococcus genera have the capacity to form endospores, which are non-replicating forms of the cell that are intrinsically resistant to antibiotics, heat and oxygen. Spore-forming pathobionts such as C. difficile sporulate in response to population density and nutrient availability. These spores survive antibiotic exposure in the gastrointestinal tract, and the presence of free nutrients and primary bile acids provides molecular signals for spore germination and subsequent pathogenesis",medium,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_008,Describe the mechanism by which butyrate consumption creates an anaerobic environment in the gut,"Beta-oxidation of butyrate by colonocytes consumes oxygen, resulting in an anaerobic milieu in the gut. Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced when butyrate levels are low. This creates a feedforward loop that results in increased luminal oxygen levels, allowing Proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to bloom. This mechanism explains many pathologies associated with a low-fiber diet",medium,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_009,How does a Western-style diet combined with antibiotics affect the gut and what are the consequences?,"Investigations into Western-style diets (high in fat and simple sugars) have shown that antibiotic treatment of mice on a high-fat diet provokes pathological inflammation at the gut mucosa and increased levels of Enterobacterales. These mice displayed immunological symptoms of pre-inflammatory bowel disease, probably due to the combined metabolic influence of the high-fat diet on gut epithelial cells and changes in microbiome structure. Such synergistic interventions free up simple sugars and ethanolamines through altered fatty acid metabolism, ultimately increasing susceptibility to enteric infection",medium,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_010,What is the difference in how antibiotics affect chromosomally-encoded versus MGE-encoded ARGs over time?,"In the short term, the increase in resistome burden after antibiotic treatment is primarily driven by the enrichment of chromosomally encoded ARGs (that is, the expansion of resistant bacterial lineages). However, the abundance of microorganisms with chromosomal ARGs declines sharply shortly thereafter (approximately 1 month). Conversely, MGE-encoded ARGs persist for longer periods after therapy cessation, probably due to the parasitic nature of MGEs (their persistence among bacterial populations despite the absence of antibiotic-mediated growth advantages or presence of fitness defects conferred on the bacterial host)",medium,comparison
antibiotic_microbiome_011,Compare the effects of vancomycin versus amoxicillin on the gut microbiome,"Vancomycin has been shown to cause a significant decrease in alpha diversity (more than twofold at the operational taxonomic unit level), an increase in primary bile acids (approximately threefold in faecal levels) and a decrease in stool butyrate and acetate levels (more than fivefold and approximately twofold, respectively) relative to amoxicillin. Paradoxically, of the two drugs, vancomycin has a narrower in vitro spectrum of activity. Vancomycin significantly decreased the relative abundance of Coprococcus eutactus, F. prausnitzii and Anaerostipes caccae (SCFA-producing Firmicutes), while increasing the relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. Three different mouse models have reproduced the superior capacity of vancomycin to decrease alpha diversity or increase pathogen susceptibility compared to more than five other antibiotic agents",hard,comparison
antibiotic_microbiome_012,Explain how DAV132 works to protect the gut microbiome during antibiotic treatment,"DAV132 is an adsorbent based on activated charcoal that reduces the faecal concentrations of moxifloxacin and fluoroquinolones without altering the serum levels of the antibiotics. DAV132 can adsorb antibiotics belonging to six drug classes ex vivo. Coadministration of DAV132 with antibiotics protects gut bacterial richness and diversity, impedes the spread of pathobionts and resistant organisms, and maintains the colonization resistance capacity of the gut against C. difficile. DAV132 can be further modified to achieve site-specific inactivation: coating of the adsorbent in a pH-dependent polymer ensures its release and activity in the colon, without compromising the antibiotic activity in the small intestine",hard,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_013,"Describe how engineered probiotics can be designed to protect the microbiome from antibiotics, using specific examples","The probiotic Lactococcus lactis was engineered to express and secrete the TEM1 β-lactamase; oral gavage of the engineered microorganism with concomitant intraperitoneal injections of ampicillin reduced the gut levels of the drug (without affecting serum concentrations), lessened collateral damage to the gut microbiome and maintained C. difficile colonization resistance in mice. Notably, TEM1 was designed to be expressed by two gene segments as two enzymatically inactive components that reconstitute the functional enzyme on secretion: this split nature of the gene minimizes the risk of its spread through HGT. Similarly, probiotic E. coli was engineered to sense extracellular sialic acid (a proxy for gut dysbiosis) and respond by producing a bile salt hydrolase, deconjugating primary bile salts in the gut, which reduced germination of C. difficile endospores",hard,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_014,What are the key limitations of short-read metagenomic sequencing for studying HGT and the resistome?,"Short-read metagenome assemblies are highly fragmented and cannot be used for identification of genetic origins (chromosome versus plasmid) and taxonomic origins of ARGs. The relatively short length of assembled contigs makes it impractical to determine the genomic origins of these contigs. Many assembled contigs, particularly those corresponding to mobile genetic elements, remain unbinned, obscuring their taxonomic origins. Additionally, because of the total DNA extraction step that typically precedes sequencing library preparation, shotgun metagenomic sequencing does not enable efficient linking of MGEs with bacterial hosts, obscuring community HGT dynamics. These limitations can be addressed through long-read sequencing and Hi-C platforms, which preserve information regarding MGE-bacterial host associations",hard,mechanism
antibiotic_microbiome_015,How does dietary fiber modulation affect microbiome recovery post-antibiotic treatment?,"Without fibre, mice with a conventional microbiome or a humanized microbiome have a delayed recovery in alpha diversity after ciprofloxacin treatment. In humans, volunteers fed omnivore and vegan diets during combination antibiotic treatment displayed an expedited microbiome recovery (as measured by alpha and beta diversity) relative to those on a fibre-free liquid diet. Specifically, fibre-containing diets encouraged a rapid restoration of stool butyrate levels and a return of Firmicutes with distinct amino acid metabolism. This demonstrates that modulation of polysaccharide or microbiota-accessible carbohydrate levels in diet is highly influential over antibiotic treatment outcomes",hard,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_001,What age ranges were used for pediatric and adult patient groups in this IBD study?,"Pediatric patients ranged from 5 to 15 years old, while adult patients ranged from 45 to 70 years old. All samples were collected during disease exacerbation between September 2024 to December 2024.",easy,factual
ibd_metabolomics_002,What sequencing platform was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing in this study?,"The MinION™ Mk1B platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, with data acquisition carried out via MinKNOW software version 22.12.7",easy,factual
ibd_metabolomics_003,What analytical instrument was used for metabolomic profiling of stool samples?,Stool samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra GC/MS system equipped with a Shimadzu HS-20 headspace extractor. The system used a VF-WAXMS column with helium as the carrier gas.,easy,factual
ibd_metabolomics_004,How many bacterial species were identified in pediatric versus adult IBD patient samples?,"Sequencing identified 554 microbial species belonging to 224 total genera in 71 pediatric patient samples, and 654 microbial species belonging to 267 total genera in 36 adult patient samples",easy,factual
ibd_metabolomics_005,What percentage of volatile compounds detected were used for metabolomic profile comparison?,"A minimum of 60% of the stable compounds identified were utilized for metabolomic profile comparison. The most frequently observed compounds meeting the screening criteria included SCFAs, medium- and long-chain fatty acids, and amino acid derivatives",easy,factual
ibd_metabolomics_006,"How did Shannon diversity index differ between pediatric and adult IBD patients, and what does this indicate?","Shannon's alpha diversity index was significantly lower in children compared to adults across both control groups and groups with colitis and CD. This reduced bacterial diversity was observed in children across all experimental conditions, indicating age-related differences in microbiome complexity. During disease development, the microbiomes of children and adults undergo similar changes, but children start with lower baseline diversity",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_007,Explain the role of indole metabolites in IBD according to the study findings,"Indole levels were significantly reduced across the entire IBD group including both CD and UC patients. This decrease indicates a diminished presence of bacteria actively producing and secreting indole, reflecting microbiota alterations. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in tryptophan metabolism, producing various indole derivatives that influence the host's immune response and intestinal health. 1H-indole-3-methyl (skatole) can enhance promoter activity of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, significantly influencing IBD development and progression",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_008,What metabolic differences distinguish UC from CD in pediatric patients?,"UC exhibits characteristic changes in pentanoic acid, 4-methylphenol (p-cresol), and acetate levels, while CD is characterized by elevated tetradecanoic acid and reduced 1H-indole-3-methyl. The UC risk prediction model incorporates three metabolic biomarkers: elevated risk coefficient score, increased acetate levels, decreased pentanoic acid, and altered excretion of p-cresol. The CD risk stratification model identifies high-risk patients based on elevated IBD risk coefficient score and reduced levels of 1H-indole-3-methyl",medium,comparison
ibd_metabolomics_009,How do SCFAs relate to IBD pathology according to the correlation analysis?,"There is considerable variability in Shannon diversity index for SCFAs in UC compared to CD. In pediatric CD, butyrate and propionate derivatives increase in tandem with changes in bacteria such as Prevotella copri and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Significant amounts of Blautia bacteria positively correlate with levels of various propionate derivatives. Alterations in gut microbiota composition and decreased fermentation of dietary fibers in IBD lead to changes in SCFAs. SCFAs play crucial roles in regulating immune responses and promoting tissue repair within the gut",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_010,What is the significance of Streptococcus salivarius as a biomarker in pediatric IBD?,"Streptococcus salivarius appears to be a universal metagenomic marker for IBD development in the pediatric group (log2FoldChange = 3.31, FDR < 0.0001). It shows significant increase in certain Streptococcus species in patients with UC. The content of Streptococcus salivarius is inversely proportional to the level of heptanoic acid. Some studies suggest it may have anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate immune responses, including inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway in human intestinal epithelial cells. However, its abundance is increased in UC patients, showing inverse correlation with heptanoic acid",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_011,Describe the functional metabolomics approach used in this study and its advantages,"Functional metabolomics combines the ability to simultaneously assess microbiome diversity and evaluate its secretory activity in pathology development. The study used HS-GC-MS (headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) for VOC profiling, which enables comparison of various biological samples including feces, since ratios of components in equilibrium vapor don't depend on water content. This approach analyzes SCFAs, medium-chain and long-chain fatty acids, acids with phenyl radicals, aldehydes, and heterocycles. The vapor-phase extraction method makes it possible to compare samples with different water content and provides insights into microbial metabolic activity",medium,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_012,"Compare the metagenomic signatures of CD between pediatric and adult patients, and explain what this reveals about disease pathogenesis","Pediatric CD patients showed significant increases in Ralstonia insidiosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum, while showing decreases in Blautia spp. and Coprococcus comes. However, the expected increase in Escherichia coli was not observed in adult CD patients, despite being elevated in pediatric CD (log2FoldChange = 3.45, FDR = 0.007). Pediatric patients had a more consolidated metabolome spectrum than adults, with more homogeneous metabolomic profiles, suggesting a special mechanism of CD development in childhood. The metabolome differences between adults and children may reflect that pediatric CD represents primary alterations, while adult CD may be caused by both endogenous and exogenous factors that dramatically change microbiota. This distinction suggests CD in children has more limited spectrum of metabolic and metagenomic changes, which may enhance prospects for identifying specific pathognomonic factors",hard,comparison
ibd_metabolomics_013,"Explain the diagnostic algorithm developed for pediatric IBD risk assessment, including the mathematical basis and clinical interpretation thresholds","The risk coefficient formula includes metabolites that are significantly different between IBD and control groups. For statistically significant metabolites, biserial correlation was calculated with FDR correction; metabolites with absolute correlation coefficient |r| > 0.3 were included. Positively correlated metabolites were placed in the numerator, negatively correlated ones in the denominator: Kr = log₁₀(1/(pentanoic acid + Phenol,4-methyl + Indole)). ROC analysis determined risk thresholds: values below the 5th percentile indicated no risk (Kr < 4.01), values between 4.01 and 4.79 suggest low risk requiring additional clinical markers, and values above 4.79 (above 25th percentile) indicate high risk requiring further examination and can detect asymptomatic cases. For differential diagnosis, high-risk CD cases show reduced 1H-indole-3-methyl, while UC cases show altered pentanoic acid, phenol 4-methyl, and acetate levels",hard,mechanism
ibd_metabolomics_014,"Analyze the paradoxical finding that pediatric IBD patients showed greater metabolite diversity than controls, contrary to expectations. What mechanisms might explain this?","Contrary to initial expectations, comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed that the control group had fewer diversely represented volatile metabolites than the IBD group in pediatric patients (opposite to adult patterns). This paradoxical finding may be explained by several factors: (1) therapy being taken by patients may introduce additional metabolites, (2) excessive bacterial growth in IBD provokes secretion of numerous volatile components, (3) treatment-derived xenobiotic metabolites significantly contribute to observed metabolic signatures. While patients with IBD typically have reduced microbiota diversity (which should result in fewer identified metabolites), the overall spectrum of detectable metabolites is actually larger due to these additional factors. In contrast, adults with chronic IBD demonstrate a more stable metabolomic profile reflecting long-term adaptation to disease. This suggests the wide variety of components in pediatric IBD patients reflects acute dysbiosis and therapeutic intervention rather than adaptive microbiome changes",hard,mechanism
