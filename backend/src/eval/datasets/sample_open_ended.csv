gut_intro_001,What are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota?,Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota,easy,factual
gut_intro_002,What is the ratio of human to bacterial cells in the body according to recent estimates?,"Recent estimates suggest that the ratio of human to bacterial cells is closer to 1:1, revising the earlier estimate of 1:10",easy,factual
gut_intro_003,How does mode of delivery affect infant gut microbiota composition?,"Vaginally delivered infants have microbiota containing high abundance of lactobacilli, while C-section delivered infants are depleted in Bacteroides and colonized by Clostridium species instead",medium,mechanism
gut_intro_004,What are short-chain fatty acids and which are the three predominant types found in the GI tract?,"Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites produced by colonic bacteria through fermentation of complex carbohydrates. The three predominant types are acetate, propionate, and butyrate, typically found in a 3:1:1 ratio",medium,factual
gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis",hard,mechanism
