Explanation: According to the text, combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date, and compiled data from these studies identified 2,172 species isolated from human beings.","['. Next, to take compositionality into account, the relative abundance table was transformed using the center log ratio (CLR) prior to PC analysis. PC analysis was carried out using the prcomp() function in the stats R package (R Core Team, 2022). Inference of taxonomic content of the gut microbiome and between- group comparisons Prior to downstream analyses, all bacterial taxa observed only in a single donor and at a relative abundance of less than 0.0001 were discarded. The choice of an abundance threshold ensured that we kept rare bacterial species that can impact human disease, as demonstrated in recent work (Chriswell et al., 2022). Metaphlan v4.0 tool was used to infer both known bacterial species and strains as well as uncharacterized bacterial species. Uncharacterized bacterial species in the metaphlan v4.0 tool are deﬁned in terms of species-level genome bins (SGBs) using so-called metagenomically assembled genomes (MAGs) (Blanco-Mı́guez et al., 2023)', '. Using MetaPhlAn2 for taxonomic proﬁling, we identiﬁed 11 phyla, 156 genera and 400 species across the three groups (Tables S2, S3, S4). Compared with the number of species present in the controls, the species present in the patients was signiﬁcantly decreased (P = 1.95E-5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1A). Consistently, the Shannon index, indicating within-sample (α) diversity, was much lower for the P groups than that for the controls (P = 2.84E- 4; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Figure 1B). NMDS analysis based on genus relative abundance also revealed striking diﬀerences between the C and P groups especially at the NMDS 2 axis (Figure 1C). Gut Bacteria Associated With M. tuberculosis Infection We then compared the relative abundance of each identiﬁed species across the two groups to identify the bacteria in the human gut microbiota that are altered in response to M. tuberculosis infection. We found that 25 species were diﬀerentially enriched in the two groups', '. More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 Introduction The association of human health with the intestine has been long acknowledged as Hippocrates said, “Death sits in the bowls” in 400 B.C. Many studies worldwide have focused on the signiﬁcant impact of intestinal microbiota on human health and disease (AboNahas et al., 2022). The human body is colonized by a diversity of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. Microbes inhabit all human body surfaces, but a signiﬁcant number of microbes live in the gastrointestinal tract/gut. The human gut possesses approximately more than one thousand microbial species that form a complex ecological community called gut microbiota (Lagier et al., 2016). The human gut microbiota is carrying about 150 times more genes compared to the entire human genome', '. Statistics All statistical analyses were performed using R packages. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to compare diﬀerences in SNP distributions between groups. Spearman’s rank test was performed to analyze the correlation between species. When multiple hypothesis tests were performed simultaneously, P-values were corrected using Benjamini and Hochberg’s false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Microbial Diversity is Decreased in TB Patients To characterize alterations in the gut microbiota in TB patients, we analyzed the microbial composition and metabolic potential of the gut microbiota in 61 samples from the C (n = 31) and P (n = 30) groups (Table S1). Using MetaPhlAn2 for taxonomic proﬁling, we identiﬁed 11 phyla, 156 genera and 400 species across the three groups (Tables S2, S3, S4)', '. 3.1.1. Increasing the Abundance of Specific Members of the Microbiome. A low microbial diversity of the human microbiome is significantly associated with several diseases.206 However, the changes observed in the microbiome composition might be dissimilar in different populations. For example, Dutch and Belgian cohorts showed a negative correlation between the Bacteroidetes enrichment and diversity,207 whereas a positive correlation was observed between Bacteroidetes and diversity in African individuals,208 underscoring the need for population- specific comparisons of the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients. The ratio of the two most dominant phyla in the microbiome, namely, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, is one of the most important parameters representing microbiome diversity, at least in the gut', '.

Introduction The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents one of the largest interfaces (250–400 m2) between the host, environmental factors and antigens in the human body. In an average life time, around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract, along with an abundance of microorganisms from the environment which impose a huge threat on gut integrity [1]. The collection of bacteria, archaea and eukarya colonising the GI tract is termed the ‘gut microbiota’ and has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years to form an intricate and mutually beneﬁcial relationship [2,3]. The number of microorganisms inhabiting the GI tract has been estimated to exceed 1014, which encom- passes ∼10 times more bacterial cells than the number of human cells and over 100 times the amount of genomic content (microbiome) as the human genome [2,4]. However, a recently revised estimate has suggested that the ratio of human:bacterial cells is actually closer to 1:1 [5]', '. First, we estimated the abundance of 58 species that were significantlydifferent in abundance between LGC and HGC individuals (Supplementary Table 6). For each individual, we used these values to compute a score, named decisive bacterial abund- ance (DBA) score, equal to the sum of abundances of the species more frequent in HGC individuals subtracted by the sum of the abundances of species more frequent in LGC individuals. The DBA scores were calculated exhaustively for all combinations of up to 19 species and were used in the ROC analysis; the area under curve (AUC) values for the best combinations are shown in Fig. 2b, left. The best combina- tion of four species gave an AUC value of 0.98 (Fig. 2b, right); in a tenfold cross-validation test40 with 90% of randomly chosen individuals the AUC value of 0.9766 0.02 (mean6 s.d.) was obtained for the groups of the remaining 10%, indicating the robustness of the analysis', '. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), based on Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac and weighted UniFrac distances were performed to identify the difference in fecal microbiota composition between PTB patients and HCs. As shown in Figure 1D, there was a tendency of separation and had a partial overlap between two groups, which demonstrated that the total community of gut microbiota in the two groups was different. The compositions of the fecal microbiota in the PTB patients and the HCs were assessed at different taxonomic levels, and the top 20 relative abundance of bacteria were shown in Figure 2A. At the phylum level, we observed an enrichment of Bacteroidota (33.10% vs. 27.08%), Proteobacteria(12.99% vs. 9.83%) and Fusobacteriota(0.58% vs. 0.56%, P<0.05), and a remarkable decrease of Firmicutes(48.07% vs. 55.89%, P<0.05) and Actinobacteriota(2.44% vs. 5.83%, P<0.01) in PTB patients compared with HCs (Figure 2B)', '. The number of genera and their relative abundance in the gut was determined by measuring the diversity of microorganisms. The beta diversity of the gut microbiota was estimated using weighted UniFrac metric principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the biological evolution information of the sequences from each sample, revealing differences in the gut microbiota community between groups. The “vegan” package was utilized to compute alpha diversity (15). The R package “encodes” was used to determine the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity between various sample types (16). Using the Galaxy Platform (https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/), we employed LEfSe to distinguish the cluster of representative bacteria (17). Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank- sum test', '. Nat. Protoc. 16, 2724–2731 (2021). 25. Blanco-Míguez, A. et al.

However, it does not provide the exact percentage of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes.","['. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), based on Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac and weighted UniFrac distances were performed to identify the difference in fecal microbiota composition between PTB patients and HCs. As shown in Figure 1D, there was a tendency of separation and had a partial overlap between two groups, which demonstrated that the total community of gut microbiota in the two groups was different. The compositions of the fecal microbiota in the PTB patients and the HCs were assessed at different taxonomic levels, and the top 20 relative abundance of bacteria were shown in Figure 2A. At the phylum level, we observed an enrichment of Bacteroidota (33.10% vs. 27.08%), Proteobacteria(12.99% vs. 9.83%) and Fusobacteriota(0.58% vs. 0.56%, P<0.05), and a remarkable decrease of Firmicutes(48.07% vs. 55.89%, P<0.05) and Actinobacteriota(2.44% vs. 5.83%, P<0.01) in PTB patients compared with HCs (Figure 2B)', 'Del Chierico et al. Gut Microbiota Age-Dependent Patterns in Obesity and Verrucomicrobia). Applying the Kruskal–Wallis test on the relative abundances of phyla for the four groups, we observed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distributions of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes (p < 0.05). However, a false discovery rate (FDR) correction of p-values deﬁned Actinobacteria as the only signiﬁcant taxon diﬀerentially describing the four groups (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S1). Particularly, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were statistically signiﬁcant for the ob_ado/ob_adult couple, with Actinobacteria levels being higher in the ob_ado group, and Bacteroidetes levels being uppermost in the ob_adult group. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were statistically signiﬁcant for adolescent obese versus CTRL (Supplementary Table S2)', '. 1c, Table S2). At the genus level, the variation trend of dominant bacterial genera (an abundance > 0.1% in the two groups) is shown in Table S3. Among the dominant microbiota, the abundance of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Feacalibacterium was higher, and the abundance of Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Eubacterium_ hallii_group were lowered in the TB group vs. HC group (Fig. 1d). To better understand the difference in micro\xad biota between the two groups, we further performed a LEfSe analysis according to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score ≥ 4.0. The results of LEfSe analysis showed that 11 key genera were different between the two groups (Fig. 1e). The cladogram Figure (from phylum to genus level) shows that altered genera mainly belonged to Bac\xad teroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Fig. 1f). Over\xad all, our data indicate that the gut bacterial diversity and composition have been altered in TB patients', '. In general, the major bacteria present in oral microbiota are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacter- oidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Although healthy human lungs were long considered sterile, numerous studies have demonstrated that microbiota is also present in lung tissues.11 The core lung microbiota included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The composition of lung microbiota is primarily determined by three factors: 1) microbial immigration, 2) the elimination of micro- organisms, and 3) the reproduction rates of microorganisms.12 In human skin, the distribution and variety of glands and hair follicles vary among each geographic region. The physical and chemical differences of skin regions create distinct composition of microbiota.13 Generally, the skin microbiota is composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria', '. Our results suggest that untreated TB patients arrive at the hospital with a strongly disturbed gut community. Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between TB patients and healthy controls We characterized microbiomes at different taxonomic resolutions to facilitate comparison with published data. At the phylum level, TB patients showed an apparent increase in Firmicutes abundance (36.4% vs. 21.3% in controls, p = 0.03) and an elevated proportion of Actinobacteria (1.8% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.0002) and Proteobacteria (5.6% vs. 3.8%, p > 0.05) (Figure 2A). This increase in Firmicutes was at the expense of Bacteroidetes (54% vs. 72.2%), a frequent sign of a disturbed gut microbiome. Taxonomic composition at the genus, family, and order levels was also strongly altered in TB patients (Supplementary Figure 2). We next used LEfSe, a linear discriminant analysis, to identify the combination of microbial species that differentiate TB patients’ gut microbiomes from HCs (Segata et al., 2011)', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. 3.1.1. Increasing the Abundance of Specific Members of the Microbiome. A low microbial diversity of the human microbiome is significantly associated with several diseases.206 However, the changes observed in the microbiome composition might be dissimilar in different populations. For example, Dutch and Belgian cohorts showed a negative correlation between the Bacteroidetes enrichment and diversity,207 whereas a positive correlation was observed between Bacteroidetes and diversity in African individuals,208 underscoring the need for population- specific comparisons of the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients. The ratio of the two most dominant phyla in the microbiome, namely, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, is one of the most important parameters representing microbiome diversity, at least in the gut', '.

Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla.

The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. The most highly represented phyla in the gastric mucosa under normal conditions are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (recently renamed to Bacillota36), Bacteroidetes (recently renamed to Bacteroidota36), Actinobacteria, and Fusobacte- ria.37−39 The gastric juice has a diverse microbial community that differs from the gastric mucosa. The dominating phyla in gastric juice are Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gastric mucosa.37,40,41 Furthermore, bacteria found in the oral cavity and duodenum such as Veillonella, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium can transiently colonize the stomach.40,42 Unsurprisingly, H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H', '. Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019). The ﬁrst step in identifying the symbiotic interactions between intestinal microbes and their hosts is to describe the balanced composition of gut microbiota and disease-related variations. The microbes reside in a mutual association with the host in a healthy state, aﬀecting the host’s health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells to promote host physiology and immunity (Ribaldone et al., 2022). An initial underestimation of the total number of microbial species in the intestine has been described through several vivo and ex vivo studies due to complications in culturing certain microorganisms (Lagier et al., 2015)', '. Eubiosis conditions are eﬀective in controlling various diseases caused by microbes. Proper intake of a healthy diet and the development of eubiosis acts in favor of human health. The high intake of antibiotics causes an imbalance in the gut microbiota and favors systemic diseases (Santacroce et al., 2021). Several population-based studies have revealed the highly beneﬁcial role of human gut microbiota in healthy people, as well as the importance of well-understanding its structure and the factors that inﬂuence its composition, such as food, age, geography, systemic disorders, and drugs (Wang et al., 2017; Rowland et al., 2018).

Non-bacterial dysbiosis. Thus far, most studies of microbial dysbiosis in the context of CRC have focused on bacteria owing to their rela\xad tively high abundance in the GI tract (comprising 93% of gut microbial sequences)44. However, improvements in sequencing technologies have enabled the detection of non-bacterial components of the gut Introduction The human gut microbiota is an ecosystem populated by bacteria, fungi, viruses, Archaea and parasites whose cells in total typically outnumber those of the host1. The number of microbial species resid\xad ing in the human gut is usually in the order of thousands at any given time2, representing a much greater level of genetic diversity than that of the human genome. Colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal (GI) tract begins in early life and co-evolves concomitantly with the host throughout development and adult life', '. The Western diet is overall linked to the surge of chronic inflammation72,73,81 leading to diet- related diseases, including obesity and many other non-communicable diseases14. Global diets associated with the microbiome Global regions have unique dietary patterns that impact the gut microbiome and host health. However, distinguishing its impacts from host-specific attributes to global or local environmental influ- ences poses a challenge, as other factors such as ethnicity also notably influence gut microbiota composition74,82. A recent study has char- acterized 5,230 gut metagenomes, reporting that members of the Bacteroides and Prevotella genera and the Firmicutes phylum are the dominant enterosignatures of Western populations, whereas non-Western populations have predominantly Prevotella spp', '. Further studies, focusing specificallyon the richness of the gut microbiota across broad cohorts, might help to determine the causes for its variation. Microbial species of LGC and HGC groups The differences in gene numbers indicate that the LGC and HGC indi- viduals contain different microbial communities. To assess the diffe- rence in phylogenetic composition between the two, we combined reference genome mapping with gene abundance data at the phylum, genus and species level. We first examined the general phylogenetic composition at higher taxonomic levels based on sample-wise rarefied read abundances that were mapped on publicly available reference genomes and binned at the genus and phylum level. Forty-six genera differed significantly in abundance between the HGC and LGC individuals (Supplementary Table 2).

Explanation: According to the context, three predominant SCFAs, propionate, butyrate, and acetate, are typically found in a proportion of 1:1:3 in the GI tract.","['. Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]. Butyrate is produced from carbohydrates via glycolysis and acetoacetyl-CoA, whereas two pathways, the succinate or propanediol pathway, are known for the formation of propionate, depending on the nature of the sugar [102]. In the human gut, propionate is mainly produced by Bacteroidetes, whereas the production of butyrate is dominated by Firmicutes [102,139,140]. For example, fermentation of starch by specialist Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, e.g. Eubacterium rectale or E. hallii, is thought to contribute signiﬁcantly to butyrate production in the colon both directly and via metabolic cross-feeding [102]. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]', '. In add- ition, the interaction between commensal microbiota and the mucosal immune system is crucial for proper immune function. Colonic bacteria express carbohydrate-active enzymes, which endow them with the ability to ferment complex carbohydrates generating metabolites such as SCFAs [136]. Three predominant SCFAs, propionate, butyrate and acetate, are typically found in a proportion of 1:1:3 in the GI tract [137]. These SCFAs are rapidly absorbed by epithelial cells in the GI tract where they are involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as gene expression, chemotaxis, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis [138]. Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 FIGURE 2 Positive health outcomes of gut microbial eubiosis. hydrogen, and carbon dioxide; these products are further used by the host or excreted (Patrascu et al., 2017). Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) distinguished in human feces, usually found in 3:1:1 to 10:2:1 molar ratio; this ratio is consistent with the values reported in the intestine in early sudden deaths (Rowland et al., 2018). These are the main SCFAs that perform several essential functions in the human body (Rauf et al., 2022). Butyrate is perhaps the essential SCFA for human health, as it is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes (Wang et al., 2019). Butyrate has the potential to act as an anti-carcinogen as it persuades apoptosis of colon cancer cells and regulates gene expression by inhibiting histone deacetylase (Havenaar, 2011; Steliou et al., 2012)', '. Low microbe numbers are present in the upper GI tract. At the same time, high microbial density and richness are observed in the large intestine, along with physiological changes in the pH and aerobic/anaerobic conditions from the small to the large intestine, with anaerobic conditions in the large intestine (Fig. 1) [103]. 1768', '.

These con- flicting reports are likely to arise from the difficulty of disentangling the effects of antibiotics on HGT rates from the antibiotic-mediated selection of transconjugants (Fig. 3), which suggests that the reported post-antibiotic enrichments of ARG-encoding MGEs often result from the growth advantage conferred on transconjugants, not higher HGT rates per se162.

For example, inulin is described as propionogenic, whereas resistant starches are more butyrogenic. Of note, several colonic bacteria use alternative pathways to also produce butyrate from amino acids such as lysine or propionate from plant compounds such as phytate.70 71 It is worth noting that the sources of SCFAs are derived from the diet and they can originate from the host itself via the fermentation of the intes- tinal mucus that covers the intestinal epithelial cells.72 SCFAs stimulate the secretion of gut peptides by acting on specific G-\xadprotein-\xadcoupled receptors expressed at the surface of the enteroendocrine L-\xadcells that are specifically abundant in the terminal ileum and colon', '. After hepatic metabolism, ~70% of colonic acetate, but only small amounts of propionate and butyrate (<2% for butyrate), reach the circulation [35]. As described in more detail in ‘Physiological and pathophysiological perspec- tives’, SCFAs regulate several processes, including intestinal motility and pH, gut barrier immune responses and systemic metabolism through pathways affecting gluconeogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion (Fig. 2) [36]. How- ever, human studies show extensive variation in the levels of different SCFAs in the stools and/or blood of individuals with type 2 diabetes, which is likely because of methodo- logical limitations [36].

Explanation: According to the context, butyrate production in the human gut is primarily dominated by Firmicutes, specifically bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum.","['. The microorganisms included in probiotic formulations can pro\xad duce a diverse range of probiotics. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, propanoate and acetate are all abundant metabolites produced by gut bacteria following the fermentation of soluble fibre. Major sources of butyrate include bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, in particular Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium leptum of', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]. Butyrate is produced from carbohydrates via glycolysis and acetoacetyl-CoA, whereas two pathways, the succinate or propanediol pathway, are known for the formation of propionate, depending on the nature of the sugar [102]. In the human gut, propionate is mainly produced by Bacteroidetes, whereas the production of butyrate is dominated by Firmicutes [102,139,140]. For example, fermentation of starch by specialist Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, e.g. Eubacterium rectale or E. hallii, is thought to contribute signiﬁcantly to butyrate production in the colon both directly and via metabolic cross-feeding [102]. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]', '. (6) Host glycans forming part of the mucous layer (produced by goblet cells), which is remarkably thicker in the large intestine than in the small intestine, also represent a nutrient source for intestinal bac- teria, supporting their growth. (7) Bile acids are secreted to the small intestine, inhibiting and favouring the growth of specific bacteria that participate in their metabolism and recirculation. Altogether, those abi- otic and biotic factors affect the ecological conditions that facilitate the survival of denser populations of bacteria moving to the most distal parts of the intestine (from \xad102–104 bacterial cells/g in the duodenum to \xad107–109 in the ileum and \xad1011–1012 in the colon) and account for differences in bacterial composition, with facultative anaerobes pref- erentially colonising the small intestine and strict anaerobes dominat- ing the microbiota of the large intestine, including butyrate producers', '. In contrast, colonic conditions support a dense and diverse community of bacteria, mainly anaerobes with the ability to utilise complex carbohydrates which are undigested in the small intestine. In the colon Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae have been shown to dominate [40,41]. In contrast with the differing microbiota composition between varying GI organs, the microbiota of different colorectal mucosal regions within the same individual is spatially conserved in terms of both composition and diversity [42,43]. This feature is apparent even during periods of localised inﬂammation [43]. On the other hand, the faecal/luminal and mucosal compositions are signiﬁcantly different [42,43]. For example, the abun- dance of Bacteroidetes appears to be higher in faecal/luminal samples than in the mucosa [42,44]. In contrast, Firmicutes, speciﬁcally Clostridium cluster XIVa, are enriched in the mucus layer compared with the lumen [44]', 'Page 10 of 12 Zhang et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2025) 25:453 the transformation of important chemical substances, including drugs [7]. In theory, the prolonged and mul- tifaceted use of broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotics, as seen in anti-tuberculosis therapy, may exert significant impacts on the gut microbiota, both immediately and in the long term. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the predominant phyla within the gut microbiota [40]. Bacteria within the phylum Bacteroidota are capable of utilizing dietary fibers, resulting in the production of SCFAs [41]. Also known as volatile fatty acids, SCFAs include acetate, pro- pionate, and butyrate [21]', '. Together, the gut micro- biome harbors 130 glycoside hydrolase, 22 polysaccharide lyase, and 16 carbohydrate esterase families, which provide the microbiome ﬂexibility to switch between different energy sources of ﬁbers depending on availability (Flint et al., 2012). Species belonging to Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are the main responders to dietary ﬁber (Deehan et al., 2017), although they contain relatively few ﬁber-metabolizing enzymes per organism. However, they generally have more specialized roles such as the initiation of complex substrate degradation. For example, administration of RS has been shown to enrich Biﬁdo- bacterium adolescentis, Ruminoccocus bromii, Eubacterium rectale, and Parabacteroides distasonis in a subset of individuals dependent on RS (Martı´nez et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2011)', '. tuberculosis infection. We found that 25 species were diﬀerentially enriched in the two groups. Among these species, 23 were enriched in healthy controls, while two were more abundant in patients (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, FDR<0.1; Figure 2A and Table S5). Strikingly, nine out of the 23 control- enriched bacteria were widely reported SCFA-producing bacteria, including ﬁve butyrate producers (Roseburia inulinivorans, R. hominis, R. intestinalis, Eubacterium rectale, and Coprococcus Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 3 April 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 90', '. Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019). The ﬁrst step in identifying the symbiotic interactions between intestinal microbes and their hosts is to describe the balanced composition of gut microbiota and disease-related variations. The microbes reside in a mutual association with the host in a healthy state, aﬀecting the host’s health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells to promote host physiology and immunity (Ribaldone et al., 2022). An initial underestimation of the total number of microbial species in the intestine has been described through several vivo and ex vivo studies due to complications in culturing certain microorganisms (Lagier et al., 2015)', '. Hence, the colonic microbiome is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria, including thousands of species and millions of genes, distrib- uted among the major phyla of Firmicutes (predom- inantly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia)7–10 (figure 1). Excreted as faeces, it is this biomass that makes up what is usually termed the gut microbiome that has been associated with a plethora of diseases and is highly modifiable by diet and drugs (table 1)', '. Eubiosis conditions are eﬀective in controlling various diseases caused by microbes. Proper intake of a healthy diet and the development of eubiosis acts in favor of human health. The high intake of antibiotics causes an imbalance in the gut microbiota and favors systemic diseases (Santacroce et al., 2021). Several population-based studies have revealed the highly beneﬁcial role of human gut microbiota in healthy people, as well as the importance of well-understanding its structure and the factors that inﬂuence its composition, such as food, age, geography, systemic disorders, and drugs (Wang et al., 2017; Rowland et al., 2018). Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019)', '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', '. Co-operation between gut microbes also allows colonisation by a more diverse set of organisms, shaping the gut microbiota community. Microbial cross-feeding is one mechanism proposed to mediate this effect. Some carbohydrate fermentation products, including lactate, suc- cinate and 1,2-propanediol, do not usually accumulate to high levels in the human colon of healthy adults, as they can serve as substrates for other bacteria, including propionate and butyrate producers [102]. For example, acetate produced by fermentation of resistant starch by R. bromii [103] or lactate produced by lactic acid bac- teria such as lactobacilli and biﬁdobacteria provides substrate for other microbiota members such as Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae which convert it into butyrate [104,105]. Recently, B. ovatus has been demonstrated to perform extracellular digestion of inulin at its own cost, but at an advantage to other species which provide reciprocal beneﬁts [106]', '. However, a recently revised estimate has suggested that the ratio of human:bacterial cells is actually closer to 1:1 [5]. As a result of the vast number of bacterial cells in the body, the host and the microorganisms inhabiting it are often referred to as a ‘superorganism’ [4,6]. The microbiota offers many beneﬁts to the host, through a range of physiological functions such as strengthening gut integrity or shaping the intestinal epithelium [7], harvesting energy [8], protecting against pathogens [9] and regulating host immunity [10]. However, there is potential for these mechanisms to be disrupted as a result of an altered microbial composition, known as dysbiosis. With increasingly sophisticated methods to proﬁle and characterise complex ecosystems being developed, a role for the microbiota in a large number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases has become steadily apparent [11,12]']","[{'content': '.

Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7.

A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella.

Acetate is produced by most gut anaerobes, whereas propionate and butyrate are produced by different subsets of gut bacteria following dis- tinct molecular pathways [102]. Butyrate is produced from carbohydrates via glycolysis and acetoacetyl-CoA, whereas two pathways, the succinate or propanediol pathway, are known for the formation of propionate, depending on the nature of the sugar [102]. In the human gut, propionate is mainly produced by Bacteroidetes, whereas the production of butyrate is dominated by Firmicutes [102,139,140]. For example, fermentation of starch by specialist Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, e.g. Eubacterium rectale or E. hallii, is thought to contribute signiﬁcantly to butyrate production in the colon both directly and via metabolic cross-feeding [102]. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]', 'filename': '1-Introduction to the human gut microbiota.pdf', 'collection': 'gut_microbiome', 'similarity': 0.1745, 'page_numbers': '[6]', 'title': 'Review Article'}, {'content': '.
