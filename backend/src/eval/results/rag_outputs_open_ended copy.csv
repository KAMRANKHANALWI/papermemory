gut_intro_001,What are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota?,Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota,"According to the provided documents, the two dominant bacterial phyla in the human gut microbiota are:

1. Firmicutes
2. Bacteroidota (previously known as Bacteroidetes)","['. More reliable estimates of microbiota composition and diversity may be provided by whole-genome shotgun metagenomics due to the higher resolution and sensitivity of these techniques [14]. Combined data from the MetaHit and the Human Microbiome Project have provided the most comprehensive view of the human-associated microbial repertoire to date [17,18]. Compiled data from these studies identiﬁed 2172 species isolated from human beings, classiﬁed into 12 different phyla, of which 93.5% belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Three of the 12 identiﬁed phyla contained only one species isolated from humans, including an intestinal species, Akkermansia muciniphila, the only known repre- sentative of the Verrucomicrobia phyla. In humans, 386 of the identiﬁed species are strictly anaerobic and hence will generally be found in mucosal regions such as the oral cavity and the GI tract [17]', '. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine. The main bacterial phyla present in the gut are Firmicutes and Bacteroides, which make up 90% of the gut microbiota.46 Other phyla that exist in the gut environment are Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomi- crobia.46 Notably, there are 200 different genera found under the Firmicutes phylum, with some examples including Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Clostridium, and Ruminococcus. Although lactobacilli are beneficial to health, some Firmicutes species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are harmful to the body when overgrown. Meanwhile, the predominant genera in Bacteroidota are Bacteroides and Prevotella. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health', '. The most highly represented phyla in the gastric mucosa under normal conditions are Proteobacteria, Firmicutes (recently renamed to Bacillota36), Bacteroidetes (recently renamed to Bacteroidota36), Actinobacteria, and Fusobacte- ria.37−39 The gastric juice has a diverse microbial community that differs from the gastric mucosa. The dominating phyla in gastric juice are Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are dominant in the gastric mucosa.37,40,41 Furthermore, bacteria found in the oral cavity and duodenum such as Veillonella, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium can transiently colonize the stomach.40,42 Unsurprisingly, H. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H', '. 3.1.1. Increasing the Abundance of Specific Members of the Microbiome. A low microbial diversity of the human microbiome is significantly associated with several diseases.206 However, the changes observed in the microbiome composition might be dissimilar in different populations. For example, Dutch and Belgian cohorts showed a negative correlation between the Bacteroidetes enrichment and diversity,207 whereas a positive correlation was observed between Bacteroidetes and diversity in African individuals,208 underscoring the need for population- specific comparisons of the microbiome between healthy individuals and patients. The ratio of the two most dominant phyla in the microbiome, namely, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, is one of the most important parameters representing microbiome diversity, at least in the gut', '. Eubiosis conditions are eﬀective in controlling various diseases caused by microbes. Proper intake of a healthy diet and the development of eubiosis acts in favor of human health. The high intake of antibiotics causes an imbalance in the gut microbiota and favors systemic diseases (Santacroce et al., 2021). Several population-based studies have revealed the highly beneﬁcial role of human gut microbiota in healthy people, as well as the importance of well-understanding its structure and the factors that inﬂuence its composition, such as food, age, geography, systemic disorders, and drugs (Wang et al., 2017; Rowland et al., 2018). Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019)', '. Rev.

Phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia contribute to the signiﬁcant resident bacterial populations in the gut microbiome (Fava et al., 2019). The ﬁrst step in identifying the symbiotic interactions between intestinal microbes and their hosts is to describe the balanced composition of gut microbiota and disease-related variations. The microbes reside in a mutual association with the host in a healthy state, aﬀecting the host’s health by controlling nutrient metabolism, defending against pathogens, and delivering signals to immune cells to promote host physiology and immunity (Ribaldone et al., 2022). An initial underestimation of the total number of microbial species in the intestine has been described through several vivo and ex vivo studies due to complications in culturing certain microorganisms (Lagier et al., 2015)', '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', '. Since gut microbiota has major impact to host innate and adaptive immune responses, the translation of ﬁndings from rodents to human should be carefully validated before drawing deﬁnite conclusions. While human and murine gut microbiota has 90% overlapping in phyla and genera levels, the composition and abundance of microbes have key discrepancies.27 For instance, the major difference is the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, where it is signiﬁcantly higher in human than mice. Particularly, human Bacteroidetes is mainly composed of Prevotellaceae and Bacteroidaceae, while mice Bacteroidetes are primarily composed of S24-7. Regarding the Firmicutes, Ruminococcaceae is the major phylum observed in human and Clostridiales is the major one observed in mice', '. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]. During the ﬁrst year of life, the microbial diversity increases and the microbiota composition converges towards a distinct adult-like microbial proﬁle with temporal patterns that are unique to each infant [32]. By around 2.5 years of age, the composition, diversity and functional capabilities of the infant microbiota resemble those of adult microbiota [24,25]. Although, in adulthood, the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable, it is still subject to perturbation by life events [33]. In individuals over the age of 65, the microbial community shifts, with an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes phyla and Clostridium cluster IV, in contrast with younger subjects where cluster XIVa is more prevalent [34]', '. Hence, the colonic microbiome is dominated by mainly anaerobic bacteria, including thousands of species and millions of genes, distrib- uted among the major phyla of Firmicutes (predom- inantly Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae), Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia)7–10 (figure 1). Excreted as faeces, it is this biomass that makes up what is usually termed the gut microbiome that has been associated with a plethora of diseases and is highly modifiable by diet and drugs (table 1)', '. Addition- ally, gut microbiota varies in different anatomical parts of the GI tract. For example, Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are found in the small intestine but not the colon. Instead, Bacteriodetes such as Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenella- ceae are often found in the colon.19 Such variations are majorly due to the different environments. In the small intestine, the transit time is short and bile concentration is high, while in the colon, which has slower ﬂow rates and milder pH, as well as larger microbial communities, especially anaerobic types, are commonly observed.20 Besides spatial distribution, gut microbiota also differs by age', '. pylori is the predominant bacterium in the stomach of H. pylori-infected patients,43 and most H. pylori strains can modulate the gastric environment, thus altering the habitat of resident microorganisms.44 Furthermore, alterations in the gastric microbiome community can increase the risk for developing gastric cancer.39 It was also reported that eradicating H. pylori increased microbial diversity in the stomach.45 Even though interactions between H. pylori and commensal bacteria in the stomach are not fully understood, the discovery of its direct effect on the healthy gastric microbiome may shed some light on ways to modulate the gastric microbiome to prevent progression to severe disease. 2.2.1.3. Intestines. The gut is the most densely and diversely colonized organ, with a bacterial-to-host cell ratio of 1:1. A vast majority of commensal bacteria reside in the colon, whereas a lower bacterial population is found in the stomach and small intestine', '. The less abundant Actinobacteria phylum is largely represented by Bifidobacterium, and this genus is known to have a positive impact on health. Under the Proteobacteria phylum, some well-known pathogens include Enterobacter, Helicobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age', '. nucleatum has a role in CRC progression and metastasis. Non-bacterial dysbiosis. Thus far, most studies of microbial dysbiosis in the context of CRC have focused on bacteria owing to their rela\xad tively high abundance in the GI tract (comprising 93% of gut microbial sequences)44. However, improvements in sequencing technologies have enabled the detection of non-bacterial components of the gut Introduction The human gut microbiota is an ecosystem populated by bacteria, fungi, viruses, Archaea and parasites whose cells in total typically outnumber those of the host1.

Introduction The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents one of the largest interfaces (250–400 m2) between the host, environmental factors and antigens in the human body. In an average life time, around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract, along with an abundance of microorganisms from the environment which impose a huge threat on gut integrity [1]. The collection of bacteria, archaea and eukarya colonising the GI tract is termed the ‘gut microbiota’ and has co-evolved with the host over thousands of years to form an intricate and mutually beneﬁcial relationship [2,3]. The number of microorganisms inhabiting the GI tract has been estimated to exceed 1014, which encom- passes ∼10 times more bacterial cells than the number of human cells and over 100 times the amount of genomic content (microbiome) as the human genome [2,4].

Many studies worldwide have focused on the signiﬁcant impact of intestinal microbiota on human health and disease (AboNahas et al., 2022). The human body is colonized by a diversity of bacteria, viruses, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. Microbes inhabit all human body surfaces, but a signiﬁcant number of microbes live in the gastrointestinal tract/gut. The human gut possesses approximately more than one thousand microbial species that form a complex ecological community called gut microbiota (Lagier et al., 2016). The human gut microbiota is carrying about 150 times more genes compared to the entire human genome', 'Page 9 of 14 Huh et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:203 Fig. 3 (See legend on previous page.)', '. The underlying mechanisms for reduced diversity are proposed to include antibiotic utilization, clinical practices (e.g., cesarean sections), and sanitation (Son- nenburg and Sonnenburg, 2014). In agreement with this notion, 706 Cell Host & Microbe 23, June 13, 2018 Cell Host & Microbe Review', '. However, a recently revised estimate has suggested that the ratio of human:bacterial cells is actually closer to 1:1 [5]. As a result of the vast number of bacterial cells in the body, the host and the microorganisms inhabiting it are often referred to as a ‘superorganism’ [4,6]. The microbiota offers many beneﬁts to the host, through a range of physiological functions such as strengthening gut integrity or shaping the intestinal epithelium [7], harvesting energy [8], protecting against pathogens [9] and regulating host immunity [10]. However, there is potential for these mechanisms to be disrupted as a result of an altered microbial composition, known as dysbiosis. With increasingly sophisticated methods to proﬁle and characterise complex ecosystems being developed, a role for the microbiota in a large number of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases has become steadily apparent [11,12]', '.

Discussion Since the advent of high-throughput microbiome characteriza- tion, it has become clear that antibiotics are one of the most common and severe perturbing inﬂuences on human microbiome composition, with both acute and longer lasting effects56,57. It also has become evident that the speciﬁc microbiome constituents have speciﬁc effects on host immunity, including inﬂuencing the abundance and function of immune cell subsets24', '.

In general, the major bacteria present in oral microbiota are Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacter- oidetes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Although healthy human lungs were long considered sterile, numerous studies have demonstrated that microbiota is also present in lung tissues.11 The core lung microbiota included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The composition of lung microbiota is primarily determined by three factors: 1) microbial immigration, 2) the elimination of micro- organisms, and 3) the reproduction rates of microorganisms.12 In human skin, the distribution and variety of glands and hair follicles vary among each geographic region. The physical and chemical differences of skin regions create distinct composition of microbiota.13 Generally, the skin microbiota is composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria', '. Hence, a concentration gradient of microbes is found along the small intestine, as microbial abundance in duodenal aspirates were found to be a 1000-\xadfold lower than that of oral samples, although consisting of somewhat similar microbial taxa.4 Consequently, the small intestine contains an increasing number of thousands to several hundred million of cells per gram of content with partly oxygen-\xadtolerant Firmicutes and Proteobacteria as major phyla.5 6 This all culminates in the lower gut where climax communities of up to 100 billion cells per gram reside for up to a few days, since transit in the colon is over a dozen times longer than that in the small intestine', '. In fact, the dose of dietary ﬁber used in animal studies more closely resembles the estimated amount of ﬁber consumed by our ancestors before the advent of agriculture (>100 g/day) (Eaton et al., 1997).

Newborns delivered via vaginal delivery possess a different group of dominant gut microbiota compared to those delivered via Caesarean section. 

Vaginally delivered infants have a high abundance of lactobacilli during the first few days, which is a reflection of the high load of lactobacilli in the vaginal flora. 

In contrast, the microbiota of infants delivered by Caesarean section is depleted and delayed in the colonization of the Bacteroides genus, but colonized by facultative anaerobes such as Clostridium species. 

Additionally, the faecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles that of their mothers' faecal microbiota, whereas in babies delivered by Caesarean section, this percentage is reduced to only 41%. 

These differences in gut microbiota composition may be due to the exposure of vaginally delivered infants to the mother's vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas Caesarean-born babies are initially exposed to the skin microbiota and the microbiome found in the environment.","['.

The human microbiome is generally stable and resistant once the microorganism has adapted to the environ- ment. On top of intrinsic factors that may cause a shift in the microbiome over time, extrinsic factors such as diet, lifestyle, medication, geographic location, climate, and seasonality may cause changes to the microbial community. Moreover, the mode of delivery during birth has been shown to influence the microbiome. For example, newborns delivered via the vaginal versus Caesarean delivery possess different groups of dominat- ing gut microbiome. However, at the age of 3, the gut microbiome changes to resemble that of the adult’s gut microbiome.7 As people reach beyond the age of 70, the ability to digest food and absorb nutrients in the gut changes, affecting the composition of the gut microbiome', '. After birth, the GI tract is rapidly colonised, with life events such as illness, antibiotic treatment and changes in diet causing chaotic shifts in the microbiota [24,25]. The mode of delivery also appears to affect the microbiota composition, with vaginally delivered infants’ microbiota containing a high abundance of lactobacilli during the ﬁrst few days, a reﬂection of the high load of lactobacilli in the vaginal ﬂora [26,27]. In contrast, the micro- biota of infants delivered by C-section is depleted and delayed in the colonisation of the Bacteroides genus, but colonised by facultative anaerobes such as Clostridium species [28,29]. Whilst the faecal microbiota of 72% of vaginally delivered infants resembles that of their mothers’ faecal microbiota, in babies delivered by C-section, this percentage is reduced to only 41% [30]. In early stages of development, the microbiota is generally low in diversity and is dominated by two main phyla, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [24,31]', '. The composition of the gut microbiota changes at three stages in life: from birth to weaning; from weaning to obtaining a normal diet; and finally, during old age. Facultative anaerobes are the first to colonize the gut at birth, and these bacteria create anaerobic conditions that promote the growth of obligate anaerobes, starting with Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides spp., within 2 weeks.47 Infants born naturally are inoculated by the mother’s vaginal and fecal microbiota during birth, whereas those born by Caesarean section are initially exposed to the skin microbiota as well as the microbiome found in the environ- ment.48 At 3 days, infants who were naturally delivered possessed a greater abundance and variety of Bifidobacterium spp', '. infantis reveals late colonization in the infant gut independent of maternal milk HMO composition.

Colonization of the newborn gastrointestinal (GI) tract begins in early life and co-evolves concomitantly with the host throughout development and adult life. The content of the gut microbiota varies considerably from person to person, and is readily modified by changes in lifestyle, such as diet, smoking and exercise; yet collectively these diverse ecosystems have similar roles in maintaining homeostasis. Gut microorganisms are indispensable for the fermenta\xad tion of non-digestible carbohydrates, nutrient absorption and vitamin biosynthesis, as well as modulation of host immunity3. A dynamic but largely stable gut microbiota is believed to be ben\xad eficial for health', '. Gathering global microbiome data to understand unique microbial associations in dif- ferent regions and develop targeted therapeutics specific to the needs of each area is vital and requires large-scale collaboration between multiple research centres worldwide. It is evident from this Review that recent research highlights diet as a confounding factor in the interpretation of causal relationships between gut microorganisms and disease in clinical studies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive dietary metadata to generalize clinical findings for the advancement of microbiome-targeted therapies.

Multiple factors contribute to the establishment of the human gut microbiota during infancy. Diet is considered as one of the main drivers in shaping the gut microbiota across the life time. Intestinal bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis and protecting against pathogens. Altered gut bac- terial composition (dysbiosis) has been associated with the pathogenesis of many inﬂam- matory diseases and infections', '. than the Caesarean-born babies.49,50 Moreover, babies who were solely breastfed until weaning were observed to generally have a more stable and less diverse bacterial community, with higher proportions of bifidobacteria than babies fed by formula milk.51−54 After being introduced to solid food, their gut microbiome diversified and the abundance of Firmicutes increased.54−56 The microbiomes of breastfed and formula-fed babies become indistinguishable by around 18 months of age. By the age of 3, their microbiomes resemble that of an adult.7,54 At old age, there is reportedly a decline in microbiota diversity, with reduced numbers of Bifidobacteria and an increase in Enter- obacteriaceae.57,58 Likewise, the abundance of Bacteroidetes increases, whereas the Firmicutes becomes less abundant in elderly adults (>65 years).59 Apart from age, gut microbiome composition is also greatly influenced by the environment in different anatomical locations', '. An unhealthy diet intake, such low intakes of fruits and vegetables intakes and overuse of antibiotics can result in dysbiosis. In nutshell, probiotics aid in the treatment of various infectious diseases, dysfunctions of the GI tract, and inﬂammatory disorders as well as in controlling obesity and diabetes. The advances in gut microbiota modeling and analysis will enhance our knowledge of how they inﬂuence health and disease, allowing us to adapt current and forthcoming therapeutic and preventive strategies. Understanding the speciﬁc roles played by the gut microbiome in our growth and development, as well as how it functions in health and disease, holds the potential to improve many parts of our daily lives, from improving the formula for infants to oﬀering new approaches in ﬁghting obesity and cancer, among others', '.

gut_intro_004,What are short-chain fatty acids and which are the three predominant types found in the GI tract?,"Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites produced by colonic bacteria through fermentation of complex carbohydrates. The three predominant types are acetate, propionate, and butyrate, typically found in a 3:1:1 ratio","According to the provided documents, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced by the gut microbiota through the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates. They are nutrients for colonocytes and enterocytes.

The three predominant types of SCFAs found in the GI tract are:

1. **Butyrate**: Produced by bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, particularly Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum. Butyrate is a major energy source for colonocytes and has anti-inflammatory properties.
2. **Propionate**: Produced by various bacteria, including those from the phylum Bacteroidetes. Propionate is involved in regulating food intake and insulin secretion, and it also aids in maintaining body weight.
3. **Acetate**: Produced by various bacteria, including those from the phylum Firmicutes. Acetate is involved in regulating lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues.

These SCFAs play important roles in maintaining gut health, regulating metabolism, and influencing the host's overall health.","['. They include by-\xadproducts of bacterial metabolism, such as SCFAs, and complex macromolecules necessary for bacterial integrity, such as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (figure 2). The abundance and availability of these metabolites are depen- dent on the microbial composition and are therefore subject to modulation by diet and environmental factors.49–51 The main molecular actors are discussed below. Short chain fatty acids and impact on host health: molecular mechanisms The small intestine is highly specialised in the break- down, emulsification and absorption of nutrients and few nutrients will escape digestion. In normal condi- tions, for example, <5 g/day of fat will reach the colon. The same principle is true for the digestion and absorp- tion of simple carbohydrates (broken down into sugar molecules) and most proteins (converted into amino acids), although, depending on the level of intake, some proteins will reach the colon', '.

Gut Microbiota Age-Dependent Patterns in Obesity diet and host mucosal secretions. Microbes ferments indigestible glycans producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are nutrients for colonocytes and enterocytes (Koropatkin et al., 2012). Greater primary bile acid biosynthesis was associated to obese adolescents, while secondary bile acid biosynthesis was associated to NW subjects. Primary bile acids (i.e., cholate and chenodeoxycholate), are deconjugated by several gram-positive bacterial species, such as Lactobacilli (Begley et al., 2006). After deconjugation, additional microbial modiﬁcations give rise to the formation of secondary bile acids (Jones et al., 2008), which is only carried out by a minor population of gram- positive anaerobic Clostridium species (Kitahara et al., 2004)', '. 1 | Macronutrient composition of whole diets and their effect on the gut microbiota.

The density and composition of the microbiota are affected by chemical, nutritional and immunological gradients along the gut. In the small intestine, there are typically high levels of acids, oxygen and antimicrobials, and a short transit time [40]. These properties limit bacterial growth, such that only rapidly growing, facultative anaerobes with the ability to adhere to epithelia/ mucus are thought to survive [40]. In mice, the small-intestine microbial community is largely dominated by Lactobacillaceae [41]. In contrast, colonic conditions support a dense and diverse community of bacteria, mainly anaerobes with the ability to utilise complex carbohydrates which are undigested in the small intestine', '.

First, certain bacteria in the large intestine could convert bile acids to secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid (Allayee and Hazen, 2015). These secondary bile acids could be reabsorbed into the blood stream, function as signaling molecules and improve liver function and metabolic homeostasis (Thomas et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2014). The Firmicutes was known to be involved in bile acid metabolism and its abundance was positively associated with the content of secondary bile acids (Jones et al., 2008; Vrieze et al., 2014).

Second, short chain fatty acids including acetate, propionate and butyrate were claimed to modulate lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues (Kimura et al., 2013). The genus Coprococcus is a major producer of butyrate (Rioscovian et al., 2016). In our work, the decreased Coprococcus was correlated with the increased TC level in the recovered group. Third, certain bacteria could produce trimethylamine (TMA) through the metabolism of dietary choline and L-carnitine. The generated TMA could be further metabolized to trimethylamine N-oxide, which inhibits reverse cholesterol transportation and increases LDLC (Wang et al., 2011; Koeth et al., 2013). The gut bacterium responsible for TMA production is unclear. However, a strong correlation was previously reported between the blood TMA level and several gut taxa, including Prevotellaceae (Koeth et al., 2013). We observed a positive correlation between Prevotellaceae and the LDLC level', '. Addition- ally, gut microbiota varies in different anatomical parts of the GI tract. For example, Proteobacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae are found in the small intestine but not the colon. Instead, Bacteriodetes such as Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenella- ceae are often found in the colon.19 Such variations are majorly due to the different environments. In the small intestine, the transit time is short and bile concentration is high, while in the colon, which has slower ﬂow rates and milder pH, as well as larger microbial communities, especially anaerobic types, are commonly observed.20 Besides spatial distribution, gut microbiota also differs by age', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 TABLE 1 Metabolites produced by gut microbiota and their functions.

gut_intro_005,Describe the role of butyrate in intestinal health,"Butyrate serves as an important energy source for colonocytes, has anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities, controls intestinal epithelial turnover by promoting proliferation at crypt bottoms while increasing apoptosis near the lumen, and enhances gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis","Butyrate plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal health by performing several essential functions:

1. **Energy source for colonocytes**: Butyrate is the primary energy source for colonocytes, the cells lining the colon. It is produced by the fermentation of dietary fibers by the gut microbiota and is essential for the proper functioning of the colon.
2. **Anti-inflammatory properties**: Butyrate has anti-inflammatory properties, which help to reduce inflammation in the gut and prevent conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
3. **Maintenance of gut barrier function**: Butyrate helps to maintain the integrity of the gut barrier by promoting the production of mucus and regulating the assembly of tight junctions between epithelial cells.
4. **Prevention of bacterial translocation**: Butyrate can attenuate bacterial translocation, which is the movement of bacteria from the gut lumen into the bloodstream, by reducing the permeability of the gut barrier.
5. **Regulation of appetite and metabolism**: Butyrate can regulate appetite and metabolism by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stimulating the release of satiety hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY).
6. **Modulation of immune responses**: Butyrate can modulate immune responses by promoting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
7. **Anticancer activities**: Butyrate has been shown to have anticancer activities, including the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.
8. **Regulation of gut homeostasis**: Butyrate helps to regulate gut homeostasis by promoting the proliferation of colonocytes and reducing the apoptosis of cells in the colon.

Overall, butyrate plays a critical role in maintaining intestinal health by regulating energy metabolism, inflammation, gut barrier function, and immune responses, and by preventing conditions such as IBD and cancer.","['. However, recent evidence shows that butyrate also strongly influences the microbial environment by communicating with colonic cells. Indeed, the abundance of oxygen in the luminal part of the gut and its gradually decreasing concentration towards the epithe- lium is a key requirement for anaerobic bacteria to remain in the close vicinity of the epithelium as opposed to facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae (phylum Proteobacteria) that have been shown to increase the risk of intestinal inflam- mation (figure 3).80 81 Butyrate contributes to control of the anaerobic condition in the colon by activating the β-oxidation in the mitochondria. By activating the nuclear receptor peroxi- some proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in the colonic cells, butyrate limits the diffusion of oxygen from the colonocytes to the luminal part, thereby maintaining the anaer- obic conditions', '. Belcheva et al. suggested that supplementation with prebiotic/butyrate could promote tumor progression due to genetic variation in individuals.345 Their ﬁndings suggest that butyrate functions as an oncometabolite, while a substantial of studies reported butyrate as tumor suppressive metabolite. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes', '. Butyrate also binds to peroxisome proliferator-\xadactivated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which in turn repress inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), decreases nitric oxide production (NO) and eventually nitrate production. Conversely, in pathological situations low butyrate content in the lumen is associated with lower PPARγ activity, increased glycolysis and lower oxygen consumption. This is associated with a higher expression of iNOS which in turn produces more NO and eventually increases nitrates availability for specific pathogens. Butyrate can also stimulate immune cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg) to reduce inflammation. The nuclear transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is highly expressed and activated in healthy colonocytes, whereas agonists of AhR are lower or reduced AhR activity can lead to altered gut barrier function', '. Indeed, butyrate is known to exhibit differential effects toward normal and cancerous colonocytes. In colon cancer cells, butyrate is metabolized to a lesser extent compared to normal cells, thereby accumulating as HDAC inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis.346 The difference observed in this study may lay between host genetic back- ground, the age, and the presence of other bacterial 853 North America 69 South America 1332 Europe 662 Asia 56 Africa 13 Pacifica 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Allergy Cancer Diabetes Related C.Difficile Infection Heart Disease HIV Inflammatory Bowel Disorders Liver Cirrhosis Mental Disease Neural Disease Obesity Other Bowel Disorders Other Infections Other Inflammatory Disease Early Phase 1 Phase 1 Phase 2 Phase 3 Phase 4 Clinical trials related to microbiota a b c d Cancer Response No response Response No response Response No response C.Difficile Infection Inflammatory Bowel Disorders 331 210 315 124 92 25 Fig', 'Afzaal et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.999001 FIGURE 2 Positive health outcomes of gut microbial eubiosis. hydrogen, and carbon dioxide; these products are further used by the host or excreted (Patrascu et al., 2017). Acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) distinguished in human feces, usually found in 3:1:1 to 10:2:1 molar ratio; this ratio is consistent with the values reported in the intestine in early sudden deaths (Rowland et al., 2018). These are the main SCFAs that perform several essential functions in the human body (Rauf et al., 2022). Butyrate is perhaps the essential SCFA for human health, as it is the primary source of energy for human colonocytes (Wang et al., 2019).

In one study, a high-fibre diet improved glucose toler- ance in individuals with type 2 diabetes, an effect that was associated with increased faecal butyrate levels and circu- lating GLP-1 [59]. GLP-1 regulates glucose homeostasis by increasing insulin secretion, promoting insulin sensitivity, and reducing hepatic glucose production (Fig. 1). Additionally, SCFAs are crucial for maintaining overall gut health and the gut barrier, as butyrate is the primary fuel source for colonocytes. In contrast, reduced butyrate drives colonocytes toward anaerobic glycolysis, which increases epithelial oxygenation, disrupting the anaerobic environment of the colon [126]', '.

A diet low in fibre is associated with a reduced CAZyme reservoir within gut microbiota34. SCFAs exhibit several health benefits, including signalling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and stimulation of the secre- tion of satiety hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY) from enteroendocrine cells. This influences appetite regulation and modulates the function of regulatory T cells, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism, having a pivotal role in regulating host energy metabolism and colonic homoeostasis35,36. Butyrate acts as an energy source for colonocytes, mediates anti-inflammatory properties through intes- tinal cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) and enhances mucus production, which highlights its role in intestinal homoeostasis opti- mizing nutrient absorption and gut barrier function37', '. Gut bacteria-derived butyrate can also evoke cyto\xad toxic T cell activity through epigenetic regulation of ID2-dependent IL-12 signalling. Accordingly, the combination of oxaliplatin and', '. The Local Beneﬁcial Effect of Fiber Intake IBD and CRC The incidence of IBD is increasing in occidental countries, and the Westernization of the diet and lower gut bacterial diversity, especially reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria, have been suggested to contribute to increased IBD prevalence (Ott and Schreiber, 2006). In agreement, low ﬁber intake is correlated with increased incidence of Crohn’s disease (Hou et al., 2011) and exacerbates colitis in mice. By investigating the effect of 40 deﬁned diets in mice, Llewellyn et al. demonstrated that dietary protein and ﬁbers had negative and beneﬁcial effects on colitis development, respectively. Similarly, mice developed DSS-induced colitis proportional to the amount of ﬁbers in the diet (Macia et al., 2015). The preventive effect of ﬁbers may be due to increased cecal SCFA levels, especially butyrate, which is known to have anti-inﬂammatory properties, potentially through GPR43 (Maslowski et al., 2009)', '. A. mucini- phila is a key propionate producer specialised in mucin degradation [141]. Propionate is primarily absorbed by the liver, whilst acetate is released into peripheral tissues [142]. The role of SCFAs on human metabolism has recently been reviewed [140,143]. Butyrate is known for its anti-inﬂammatory and anticancer activities [140,143]. Butyrate is a particularly important energy source for colonocytes [138]. A decreasing gradient of butyrate from lumen to crypt is suggested to control intestinal epithelial turnover and homeostasis by promoting colonocyte proliferation at the bottom of crypts, whilst increasing apoptosis and exfoliation of cells closer to the lumen [144]. Butyrate can attenuate bacterial translocation and enhance gut barrier function by affecting tight-junction assembly and mucin synthesis [140]. SCFAs also appear to regulate hepatic lipid and glucose homeostasis via complementary mechanisms', 'intestinal barrier integrity and reducing colon cancer risk.331 SCFAs, particularly butyrate, are also able to regulate appetite, decrease insulin resistance, promote fat oxidation, and stimulate the release of insulinotropic hormones.332,333 Due to these effects on host metabolic activity, butyrate is likely to have a therapeutic effect on patients with obesity and diabetes. Oral delivery of butyrate is challenging due to its poor bioavailability and disagreeable odor and taste. Thus, different bacteria have been metabolically engineered to produce butyrate in the gut as an alternative treatment for obesity and diabetes. Bacillus subtilis SCK6 naturally produces butyrate at very low levels and thus was engineered to produce butyrate via the butyryl CoA:acetic acid CoA transferase pathway that is present in the gut’s butyrogenic microbes.334 Further deletion of competing metabolic pathways yielded a strain that can produce 1.5 g/L of butyrate in vitro', '. However, such high doses of inulin would most likely not be tolerated in humans (Figure 1). An important recent discovery from the B€aumler lab demon- strated that beta-oxidation of butyrate by colonocytes con- sumes oxygen and results in an anaerobic milieu in the gut (Byndloss et al., 2017). Since butyrate-producing bacteria are very sensitive to oxygen, their abundance is reduced further, lowering the amount of butyrate production. This feedforward loop results in increased luminal oxygen levels, allowing Proteo- bacteria such as Escherichia coli and S. enterica serovar Typhi- murium to bloom. This novel mechanism provides not only an explanation for many of the pathologies associated with a low-ﬁ- ber diet, but also a mechanistic understanding for why reduced microbial diversity is observed in both humans and mice on a low-ﬁber diet.
